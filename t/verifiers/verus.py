"""t.verifiers.verus — the second kernel.

Verdict mapping (Verus 0.2026.08.30.b432e82, per the WS-7 dossier and
measured here): exit codes are 0/1 only, so the taxonomy comes from
--output-json plus the message stream. VERIFIED demands POSITIVE evidence,
all five at once: verification-results present, errors == 0 with success,
verified >= 1, at least one non-spec fn carrying a real `ensures` clause,
and — the last gate — a kernel-native vacuity probe that comes back clean.
The Wave-1 audit (2026-08-31) measured success=true with verified=0 for an
empty verus!{} block, a spec-only file, and a #[verifier::external] theorem
— all three scored VERIFIED under the old errors==0 test. verified counts
only functions whose obligations the solver actually discharged, so
verified >= 1 is the obligation evidence; the ensures scan closes the
remaining trivial pass (exec fn with no ensures: verified=1, zero theorems).

VACUITY IS ASKED OF THE KERNEL, NOT OF A REGEX. Two native instruments,
in order of what they cost:

1. --no-cheating. Verus's own flag for "reject assume, admit,
   verifier::external_body and assume_specification". It is the kernel
   deciding, by construct identity rather than by spelling, so it holds
   against renames and homoglyphs the token scan cannot see: measured
   2026-08-31, h_assume.rs and h_extbody.rs are refused with
   "assume/admit not allowed with --no-cheating" at encountered-vir-error,
   and honest lowerings are byte-for-byte unaffected (count_matches,
   seq_max: verified 4 and 6, errors 0, with and without the flag).

2. The precondition smoke probe (_probe_vacuity), this adapter's answer to
   Dafny's --warn-contradictory-assumptions: Verus has no such flag, so the
   question is put to the solver directly. For every non-spec fn carrying a
   `requires`, the probe appends to the source a second verus!{} block
   holding a proof fn with THAT function's parameters and THAT function's
   requires clauses verbatim, no ensures, and a body of exactly
   `assert(false);`. If the solver proves it, the precondition is
   unsatisfiable and every obligation the original function "discharged"
   under it proved nothing — VACUOUS. Appending rather than rewriting is
   what makes it robust: the probe fn sees the file's own spec fns, types
   and imports, so it compiles whenever the original does.

   The probe is PER FUNCTION, which is the point. `verified` is a FILE-WIDE
   SUM, so one honest proof fn paired with one unsatisfiable-requires fn
   scores verified=2, errors=0 (measured, n_truepplusvac.rs) while the file
   contains a function that ensures false. Each probe fn contributes exactly
   one obligation at a line this adapter generated and therefore knows, so
   the diagnostic spans name which function is vacuous regardless of what
   the rest of the file did.

   Self-check, because a probe that silently fails to compile would report
   every precondition as unsatisfiable: the appended block ends with a
   canary proof fn with NO requires and the same `assert(false);`. It must
   come back refuted. If it does not — the probe file did not build, the
   run timed out, the JSON did not parse — the instrument had no reading,
   so the file cannot be certified: TOOL_ERROR, never VERIFIED. Same for a
   function the probe cannot express (generics, a where clause, or a `self`
   receiver — none of which t emits): refuse the file rather than skip the
   function.

   Cost, measured 2026-08-31 on this box: the probe is the LAST gate, so it
   runs only on files that would otherwise be VERIFIED, and not at all on a
   file where no function has a requires (abs, max: zero extra runs). Where
   it runs it costs one extra Verus invocation, 318-407 ms against a
   330-540 ms first run.

The lexical scans stay as a cheap second line, never as the thing the
soundness claim rests on. The ban is prefix-matched (`assume\\w*` etc.)
because Wave-1's \\b-delimited exact words missed assume_specification and
#[verifier::external] ('_' is a word char, and `external` was not listed).
`requires false` is the same hazard from the other side (measured VERIFIED,
Wave-1 h_reqfalse). Both are strictly redundant now — --no-cheating and the
smoke probe catch a superset, including the cases the regexes provably miss:
`requires 1 == 0` and `requires x < x` carry no `false` token at all, and
`requires ({ let b = false; b })` hides the token behind a `{` the
tempered-dot stops at (measured VERIFIED, all three, before the probe).
The scans are deliberately asymmetric about inert text:
  - ban + requires-false run on the RAW decoded source (a hit in a comment
    or string over-flags to VACUOUS — fails closed; stripping first would
    let a stripper bug hide a live assume behind a `"//"` string);
  - the positive ensures evidence runs on comment/string-MASKED source (a
    masking bug can only hide a real ensures, which scores MALFORMED —
    fails closed; raw text would let `// ensures` fake the evidence).
Ban matching also folds NFKC + common Cyrillic homoglyphs + zero-width
chars: a look-alike `аssume` is not the Verus builtin (rustc rejects the
identifier, so verified>=1 already refuses the file); folding upgrades that
refusal to VACUOUS.

TIMEOUT: the Wave-1 sniff (`"rlimit" and "exceeded" anywhere in output)
was source-spoofable — a comment `// rlimit exceeded` is quoted verbatim in
the diagnostic gutter, flipping a REFUTED into TIMEOUT (measured,
c_rlimitword). The check is now anchored to the tool's own header line
(`error:`/`note:` at column 0 — gutter-quoted source always carries a
`N | ` prefix), uses the exact phrase embedded in the rust_verify binary
(": Resource limit (rlimit) exceeded"), and additionally requires
errors > 0 in verification-results (a compile_error! spoof fails rustc with
errors == 0 and stays MALFORMED).

Budget: --rlimit (solver resource multiplier), deterministic where
wall-clock is not — same doctrine as Dafny's. The bundled Z3 is used as
shipped; the release bundle pins it, and version() records the identity.
