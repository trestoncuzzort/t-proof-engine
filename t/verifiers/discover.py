"""discover.py — find a kernel's binary without hardcoding one machine's paths.

Every adapter used to name a macOS/arm64 install location as its default:
`~/.local/verus/verus-arm64-macos/verus`, `gnatprove-aarch64-darwin-16.1.0-1`,
and so on. That works exactly on the machine those were installed on. Clone the
repository onto the Ubuntu box and t finds no kernel at all — not because the
kernels are absent, but because the adapter is looking somewhere that only
exists on a Mac.

Resolution order, most explicit first:
  1. the adapter's environment variable (T_VERUS_BIN, T_GNATPROVE, ...) —
     always wins, so a pinned install can be named exactly;
  2. PATH — the normal way a tool is found, and the way opam, elan, rustup and
     package managers all expect;
  3. glob patterns under $HOME for the tarball-style installs that never put
     anything on PATH.

`missing()` returns why nothing was found, so an absent kernel produces a
sentence rather than a stack trace — t/run_all.py prints it as ABSENT and
carries on with the kernels that are present. A kernel that cannot be found is
recorded, never silently skipped.
