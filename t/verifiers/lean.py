r"""t.verifiers.lean — the fourth kernel, and the first proof assistant.

Shape difference, stated first: Lean has no SMT sidecar — "verified" means
THE KERNEL ACCEPTED A PROOF TERM. t's Lean lowering must therefore emit a
proof, and v0's fragment (linear integer arithmetic) makes that mechanical:
`omega` is a decision procedure for LIA living in core Lean, and its output
is still kernel-checked — the tactic is automation, never the authority.

VERIFIED requires POSITIVE EVIDENCE, not absence of complaints. Wave-1
audit (2026-08-31, lean 4.33.1) produced nine false VERIFIEDs against the
exit-0-plus-clean-audit rule: `@sorryAx _ false` applied directly (no
`sorry` word for the ban regex, no audit line to trip the allowlist), a
macro expanding to sorryAx, `/- x -/ axiom` dodging the `^\s*axiom` anchor,
`#guard_msgs (drop info)` swallowing the `#print axioms` output, a decoy
audit on `True` beside an unaudited false theorem, the empty file, a
comments-only file, T_LEAN_BIN=/bin/true (empty output = "clean audit"),
and a generated-shaped file with the proof replaced by sorryAx. All shared
one root: the audit was source-controlled, so withholding or suppressing it
looked identical to passing it.

The audit is now ADAPTER-CONTROLLED. verify() extracts every `theorem
<name>` from the comment-stripped source, appends to a temp copy a sentinel
theorem carrying a per-run random nonce plus its own `#print axioms` for
the sentinel and for each extracted name, and accepts only audit lines
printed AFTER the sentinel's own line (the nonce cannot be forged by the
source; lean prints messages in file order, and the appended commands are
last — measured 2026-08-31: a trailing `#guard_msgs (drop info) in` or
`#exit` in the source suppresses/absorbs appended commands, which then
FAILS this check rather than passing it). VERIFIED requires ALL of:
  - at least one `theorem` declaration in the source (zero -> MALFORMED);
  - no banned token (below) in the comment/string-stripped, NFKC-normalized
    source (-> VACUOUS, without consulting the kernel: the measured trap —
    in-file set_option overrides the CLI budget — is why the scan is first);
  - exit 0;
  - the nonce sentinel audit line present in the output (absent, or empty
    output, -> TOOL_ERROR: kernel evidence was not produced);
  - every extracted theorem has a post-sentinel audit line, and every audit
    line anywhere lists only {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}.

Verdict classification (lean 4.33.1, measured on this machine 2026-08-31):
  banned token in stripped source                            -> VACUOUS
  zero theorem declarations (empty/comments-only/junk)       -> MALFORMED
  "maxHeartbeats" / "deterministic timeout" in output        -> TIMEOUT
  exit 0, sentinel + all audits present, allowlisted         -> VERIFIED
  exit 0, any audit lists a non-allowlisted axiom            -> VACUOUS
  exit 0, sentinel or a theorem's audit missing              -> TOOL_ERROR
  "omega could not prove" / "unsolved goals" / tactic-failed -> REFUTED
  any other nonzero (parse/elaboration errors)               -> MALFORMED
REFUTED is tested before MALFORMED because proof failures also exit 1.

Ban list (second line of defense; the positive audit above is what makes a
missed token unable to yield a false VERIFIED): sorry/sorryAx/admit,
native_decide + its axioms' names, the `axiom` keyword anywhere (not
line-anchored), macro/syntax/elab/notation machinery (an in-file macro can
expand to sorryAx), guard_msgs, set_option (covers maxHeartbeats and
debug.skipKernelTC), #eval/#exit/run_cmd/initialize/import (compiler-API
and elaboration-abort routes), variable (hypothesis smuggling into a
same-named theorem), implemented_by/extern (compiler-trust attributes).
None of these tokens appears in lower_lean.py output; the scan runs on
comment-stripped text so an honest comment mentioning "sorry" does not
trip it (wave-1 of1..of3 probes), and on NFKC-normalized text so fullwidth
homoglyphs of ASCII tokens do not evade it.

Budget: -DmaxHeartbeats, Lean's deterministic counter. Determinism is
architectural; flake_check re-measures it anyway because re-measuring is
cheap.
