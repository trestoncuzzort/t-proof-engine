# Specification repair

For each task whose spec admits a survivor (`t/audit.py`), the clauses `t/repair.py` adds: each holds for the real program at every domain point, and together they kill every survivor they can. **after** is the repaired task's own audit, from scratch.

- tasks with survivors: 20; repaired to zero survivors: 4
- refused because the real body never reads its parameters: 6
- verus: repaired contract proved for the real body, twin refuted: 3 of 4
