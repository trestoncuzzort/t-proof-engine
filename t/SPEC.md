# t: task format

SPEC version 1.0-rc1, 2026-09-11, with the typed inline surface extension
of 2026-09-19 below; t:0 frozen, t:1 a superset. The extension changes no
core AST forms or kernel semantics.

A task is one JSON object. Every field is required unless marked optional.
Two format versions exist. `"t": 0` is frozen: everything in the v0 section
is unchanged and every v0 task remains valid byte-for-byte. `"t": 1` is a
strict superset that opens three expressiveness gates: quantifiers over
sequences, loops with invariants, recursion with termination measures. A v1
task may use any v0 construct; a v0 task may use nothing from v1.

Integer semantics in both versions: **mathematical integers**, unbounded, no
overflow. Backends whose native integers are bounded must add explicit range
obligations or abstain; t does not paper over a semantic difference with a
syntax.

## Decisions since t:0

An index, not a restatement: one or two sentences per semantic decision this
file has taken since `t:0` froze, each pointing at the section that states
it in full. ROADMAP 13.4's own list, in that order.

- **Typed inline helpers (2026-09-19).** Acyclic expression definitions can
  return every existing value type and expand hygienically into the checked
  core. Their meaning is substitution, including short-circuit definedness;
  see "Typed inline helpers (surface, v1)" below.

- **Definedness and undefined witnesses.** `and`/`or`/`implies`/`ite` are
  non-strict (short-circuiting); `div`/`mod`/`at`/array indexing are
  partial, and an input on which the body or a `requires` is undefined is
  reported as such and never as REFUTED. See "Definedness".
- **The frame rule.** A `while` loop havocs exactly the variables its own
  body assigns and nothing else; every other in-scope variable is frame-
  equal across the loop by construction, one equality obligation per
  preserved variable. See "Gate 2: loops + invariants".
- **The twin rule.** A task whose twin VERIFIES is decorative: the twin is
  known broken (a vacuous spec, or an invariant-drop the kernel re-derives),
  so a twin VERIFIED now names one specific defect rather than reading as
  an ordinary result, and is unsound only when the interpreter's own
  witness entailed a refutation the kernel missed. Landed 2026-09-11. See
  "The twins".
- **Twin order.** The extensional (behavioral) rungs are tried before
  invariant-drop, not after: an INVARIANT-DROP twin is not a wrong
  program, so a body with a value-witnessed twin gets that twin instead. A
  kernel that VERIFIES an invariant-drop twin re-derived the dropped
  annotation, a new label ("re-derived") distinct from "unsound" and
  "decorative". Landed 2026-09-12. See "The twins", the dated paragraph.
- **Div-mod rounding.** Euclidean: `mod` is always non-negative in `[0,
  |y|)` regardless of operand signs; `y == 0` is undefined for both `div`
  and `mod`, not a third rounding mode. See "Division and modulo (v1)".
- **Early exit.** A `return` statement leaves the enclosing function
  immediately; no statement of its own block may follow it (well-formedness
  refuses that), and a `return` inside a loop is well-formedness-legal only
  where reachable. See "Early exit (v1)".
- **Arrays as seq values, and the invariant order rule.** There is no heap
  and no aliasing: an array is a `seq` value, mutation is functional
  (`update`/`fill` return a new sequence), and the loop frame rule havocs a
  `seq` local or return by name like any other variable. Loop invariants
  that mention a mutated sequence must state its length before its
  elements, the order rule every lowering's invariant emission follows. See
  "Sequences as values (v1)".
- **Sequence literals, concatenation and slices.** `seq` literals, `++`
  concatenation and `[lo, hi)` half-open slices are total on in-range
  arguments and undefined out of range, following the same definedness
  discipline as `at`. See "Sequences: literals, concatenation, slices
  (v1)".
- **Pairs.** A pair is one value, fst/snd projection, no pair of pairs, no
  seq of pairs, no triple; the loop frame rule havocs a pair variable by
  name like any other. See "Pairs (v1)".
- **Nested sequences.** One level deep only: a `seq` of `seq<int>` rows, no
  third level, no `seq` of bools, no `seq` of pairs; the frame rule havocs a
  nested seq by name, and the interpreter's length cap applies to both
  levels. See "Nested sequences (v1)".
- **Strings as code points.** A string is a `seq` of code points (Unicode
  scalar values as integers), not a distinct type; every `seq` operator
  (literals, concatenation, slices, `at`, `update`) applies to a string
  unchanged. See "Strings as sequences of code points (v1)".
- **The string library (v1).** `split`, `join`, `tostr`, `count`, `find`,
  `strip`/`lstrip`/`rstrip`, `replace`, `lower`/`upper`,
  `isdigit`/`isalpha`/`isupper`/`islower`, `startswith`/`endswith`, landed
  2026-09-11; `format`/f-strings, `int(x, base)`, a multi-code-point
  separator, `splitlines`, the padding members, `title`/`capitalize`/
  `swapcase`, `partition` and `encode` are named out of scope by name, not
  omitted by accident. See "The string library (v1)" and "What v1 does not
  claim".

No rule changes here: every decision above is stated in full, with its
normative text, at the section named. This index exists so a conformance
probe (`t/conformance.py`) or a reader auditing 1.0 has one place to check
that every decision taken since `t:0` is both named and pointed at.

## v0 (`"t": 0`)

```
{
  "t": 0,                          // format version, integer
  "name": "abs",                   // [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*
  "params":  [{"name": "x", "type": "int"}],
  "returns": [{"name": "r", "type": "int"}],   // exactly one in v0 and v1
  "requires": [ Expr, ... ],       // conjoined; empty list = true
  "ensures":  [ Expr, ... ],       // conjoined; must be non-empty
  "body": [ Stmt, ... ]            // straight-line + if; must end every path in assign
}
```

### Expr (v0)

```
{"int": n}                                   // integer literal
{"var": "x"}                                 // parameter or return name
{"op": OP, "args": [Expr, ...]}
```

`OP` ∈ arithmetic `+ - * neg` (neg is unary), comparison `== != < <= > >=`,
logic `and or not implies`. `and`/`or` are n-ary; `not`/`neg` unary; the rest
binary. Division and modulo are absent from v0; v1 has them as `div` and
`mod` (below), with one semantics stated for every column, since 2026-09-08.
Until then they were absent from v1 too, because the seven kernels split
three ways on negative operands (Euclidean, truncating, floor) and t refuses
to paper over a semantic difference with a syntax; the gate opened by
stating the semantics and measuring each column against it.

### Stmt (v0)

```
{"assign": ["r", Expr]}
{"if": {"cond": Expr, "then": [Stmt, ...], "else": [Stmt, ...]}}
```

## v1 (`"t": 1`): the three gates

New top-level fields, all optional unless a gate below requires them:

```
"gate": "quantifiers" | "loops" | "recursion"   // which gate the task exercises; informational
"spec_funs": [ SpecFun, ... ]                   // pure recursive definitions usable in specs
"decreases": Expr                               // termination measure for a self-recursive body
```

New type: `"seq"`, a finite immutable sequence of mathematical integers.
A parameter type from the start; since 2026-09-09 also a return and local
type ("Sequences as values" below). New type: `"bool"`, usable as a
return or local type.

### Division and modulo (v1)

`{"op": "div", "args": [x, y]}` and `{"op": "mod", "args": [x, y]}`, both
int × int → int, written `x / y` and `x % y` in the notation. The semantics
is Euclidean: for `y != 0`, `q = div(x, y)` and `r = mod(x, y)` are the
unique integers with `x == q * y + r` and `0 <= r < |y|`. So `-7 / 2 == -4`,
`-7 % 2 == 1`, `7 / -2 == -3`, `7 % -2 == 1`, `-7 / -2 == 4`, `-7 % -2 == 1`.
At `y == 0` both are undefined, a definedness obligation under the rules
below, exactly as `at` is undefined outside `[0, len)`.

Why Euclidean: it is the convention of SMT-LIB's `div`/`mod`, Dafny, Boogie,
Verus and Lean 4's `Int` division, F*'s `/` and `%` (all measured on the
pinned kernels, 2026-09-08), and therefore of every DafnyBench program, so
the lifter maps Dafny's `/` and `%` one to one with no domain restriction.
Where a kernel's native operator is not Euclidean (rocq 9.2's `Z.div` and
`Z.modulo` are floor; SPARK, C and ACSL truncate), its lowering defines
`div` and `mod` in the kernel's own terms (`mod(x, y) = x mod |y|` in the
kernel's floor or sign-of-divisor modulo with a positive divisor, then
`div(x, y) = (x - mod(x, y)) / y`, an exact division) and proves nothing
about the operator by name: the committed task `remainder` states the
Euclidean law as its `ensures` and a column that verifies it has shown its
lowering implements this semantics; the twin table shows the twin refuted.
No lowering may emit a kernel's native `/` or `%` where that kernel's
convention differs from this one.

### Definedness

v1 admits partial operators (`at`, `div` and `mod`, above), so definedness
is part of the semantics and is stated once: `and`, `or` evaluate left to right and the
k-th argument need only be defined when no earlier argument decided the
result (`and`: all earlier args true; `or`: all earlier args false).
`implies p q`: q need only be defined when p is true. `ite`: the taken
branch only. `forall`/`exists`: `lo` and `hi` must be defined; the body must
be defined for every value of the bound variable in `[lo, hi)`. `requires`
clauses are checked left to right, each assuming the earlier ones; each
`ensures` clause may assume `requires` and all earlier `ensures`; each loop
invariant may assume earlier invariants in its list. Every lowering must
either discharge these definedness obligations in its kernel (Dafny-style
well-formedness) or abstain; a lowering that silently totalizes `at` is
wrong.

**Undefined `requires` (normative).** The `requires` clauses themselves
owe definedness, and they owe it unconditionally: clause k must be defined
at every type-correct input at which clauses 1 through k-1 are defined and
true, because nothing else is in scope to guard it. A task whose
`requires` is undefined at such an input (`requires at(s, 0) == 0` with
nothing establishing `len(s) > 0`, undefined at the type-correct input
`s = []`) is DEFECTIVE, the task author's error. It does not mean "inputs
where the requires is undefined are excluded"; a lowering that can detect
the defect must surface it, so that the real lowering fails and the task
cannot count, rather than quietly narrowing the domain to wherever the
clause happens to evaluate. What is, measured 2026-09-02 on exactly that
probe (unwitnessed: the run's artifact was not kept, no committed probe
task, results table, or docstring states the count below independent of
this prose): six of the seven lowerings surface it and none of the six
verifies the probe. dafny (native well-formedness checking of contracts), verus
(one wf lemma per requires clause, each assuming the earlier clauses),
lean (one wf theorem per clause), rocq (one definedness lemma per clause),
spark (the `at` wrapper's own precondition, checked by the kernel inside
the contract) and fstar (the index refinement on `Seq.index`) all reject
the real lowering: dafny and fstar score the probe REFUTED through their
well-formedness and typing channels (unwitnessed per-column verdict),
verus, spark, lean and rocq score it
UNPROVED (unwitnessed per-column verdict). framac is the known gap and verified the probe: WP's
logic is total, an out-of-range `s[i]` denotes an unconstrained value, and
an undefined requires quietly becomes a constraint on that value.
lower_framac.py discharges definedness for executable positions and for
`ensures` clauses (the ensures side landed 2026-09-01, commit dc995d52); its `requires`
side, and the same total-logic softness in invariant and spec_fun-body
positions, is recorded future work in that file's own docstring, not
silently claimed here.

**The harness refuses it too (added 2026-09-11, ROADMAP 13.4):**
`harness.twin_for` names a requires undefined at every type-correct input
`"vacuous-requires-undefined"` and refuses the whole cell before any
kernel is asked, exactly as a well-defined but unsatisfiable `requires`
already refuses, and `lower_framac.py`'s `requires` side now emits its
own `defs()` obligation as a companion clause too, so framac reads
VACUOUS rather than VERIFIED even when that harness refusal is bypassed.

**The ensures-level undefined witness (2026-09-12, ROADMAP 13.4, the
harness column).** `harness.real_witness` names a second, distinct
undefined case: a `requires`-satisfying input where the real body HAS a
value but `ensures` itself is undefined there (an unguarded `at`, slice
bound, or div/mod by zero written into the postcondition) -- reported as
`_kind: "undefined"`, `_site: "ensures"`, `_expr` the first offending
sub-expression in evaluation order (interp.Undef's own `expr`), and no
`_twin`, distinct from the body-level undefined witness (`_twin` present,
no `_site`/`_expr`); a lowering must certify that this obligation fails
at the witness's input, so the real reads REFUTED, the behaviour
`lower_framac.py`'s `ensures`-side `defs()` companion clause already
matches.

**Invariants are checked in order (stated 2026-09-09, measured on the
sequences-as-values fuzz family).** A loop's invariants are a list, and
every kernel discharges the definedness of an invariant with only the
earlier invariants of the same list in context, exactly as `and` reads
left to right. So an invariant that reads `r[k]` for `k < i` must come
after the invariants that bound `len(r)` and `i`; written the other way
round, six columns read the task unproved on the invariant's own
definedness (Dafny: "index out of range" on the invariant itself) while
the interpreter, which only ever sees reachable states, saw nothing wrong.
The committed `reverse` task is written in the checkable order: length,
range, then the value invariant.

### Gate 1: quantifiers + sequences

Semantics: a `seq` value s has a length `len(s) >= 0` and elements
`s[0] … s[len(s)-1]`, each a mathematical integer. Sequences are values:
no aliasing, no mutation, no heap.

New Expr forms:

```
{"bool": true|false}                             // boolean literal
{"op": "len", "args": [Expr]}                    // length of a seq; int >= 0
{"op": "at",  "args": [SeqExpr, IdxExpr]}        // s[i]; DEFINED IFF 0 <= i < len(s)
{"forall": {"var": ID, "lo": Expr, "hi": Expr, "body": Expr}}
{"exists": {"var": ID, "lo": Expr, "hi": Expr, "body": Expr}}
{"ite": {"cond": Expr, "then": Expr, "else": Expr}}   // conditional expression
```

`forall` means: for every integer i with `lo <= i < hi`, body holds. `exists`
means: for some such i. The range is half-open `[lo, hi)`; `hi <= lo` gives
the empty range (forall = true, exists = false). Quantification is bounded by
design, because every kernel on the WS-7 list can express a bounded integer
quantifier; unbounded quantification is a later gate, not a notational
convenience to smuggle in. The bound variable is a fresh name scoped to
`body` and must not collide with any name already in scope at that point
(params, returns, locals, enclosing bound variables). `==`/`!=` apply to two
ints or two bools; `< <= > >=` are int-only. `at` outside `[0, len)` is
undefined, and the definedness rules above say who must guard it.

Scope rule (v0 had it implicitly): `requires` sees params; `ensures` sees
params and returns; body expressions see params, returns, and locals declared
above them; invariants see all of those.

### Gate 2: loops + invariants

New Stmt forms:

```
{"var": {"name": ID, "type": "int"|"bool"|"seq", "init": Expr}}    // local, initialized
{"return": [ID, Expr]}                                       // early exit: ID is the return name
{"while": {"cond": Expr,
           "invariants": [Expr, ...],       // conjoined; may be empty
           "decreases": Expr,               // required on every loop
           "body": [Stmt, ...]}}
```

`assign` now targets any return or local name in scope. Loop semantics are
the standard partial-correctness-plus-termination package: every invariant
must hold on entry and be preserved by one iteration (assuming the guard);
after the loop, invariants hold and the guard is false. `decreases` is an
int-valued expression that is `>= 0` whenever the guard holds and strictly
decreases across every iteration; it is required, not optional: a t task
never states a loop it cannot bound. The kernel discharges all of it; t
checks nothing itself.

**The frame rule (normative).** A `while` loop havocs exactly the
variables assigned in its body: the syntactic assigned set, computed from
the body AST (an `assign` target anywhere in the body counts, including
under an `if` or inside a nested `while`), intersected with the names in
scope at the loop (a local declared inside the body does not outlive the
body and is excluded). Every other variable in scope is preserved across
the loop, and no invariant is needed to say so; invariants carry
information only about the havocked variables and the values readable from
them. This sentence exists because "the standard package" underdetermines
it: a lowering that havocs every mutable name and one that havocs only the
assigned set prove DIFFERENT theorems, and a task whose `ensures` depends
on a variable the loop never assigns is provable under one and not the
other with neither lowering looking wrong. Measured 2026-09-02 with two
probes on the training box (a return assigned before the loop and never
inside it; a prefix local never assigned in the loop and read after it):
dafny, verus and framac already implemented this rule (native loop
targets, read-only helper parameters, and `loop assigns` from the assigned
set, respectively) and verified both probes, while the fstar, lean, rocq
and spark lowerings threaded every in-scope mutable name through their
loop encodings under a contract stating only invariants plus the negated
guard, which is the havoc-everything theorem: lean and rocq scored both
probes UNPROVED, spark scored both TIMEOUT, and fstar scored both REFUTED
(unwitnessed as this specific verdict word: lower_fstar.py's own dated
note records fr_probe_ret/fr_probe_local as having "failed" the old
lowering, not the REFUTED classification by name),
its solver rejecting the havoc-everything obligation the old lowering had
emitted in place of the task's theorem. All four were fixed the same day
(each loop helper now threads exactly the assigned set, or carries one
frame equality per preserved variable); with the fixes all seven kernels
verify both probes, flake-checked, and the artifacts emitted
for every committed task are byte-identical to before the fix, because
every committed loop assigns every variable in scope. A loop whose body
assigns nothing in scope havocs nothing; such a loop cannot satisfy its
own `decreases` obligation whenever the guard can hold, so no provable t
task contains one, and a lowering may refuse the shape outright (an
ABSTAIN, never a verdict).

### Gate 3: recursion + termination

A SpecFun is a pure total function defined by well-founded recursion,
usable in `requires`, `ensures`, `invariants`, and bodies:

```
{"name": ID,
 "params": [{"name": ID, "type": "int"|"seq"}, ...],
 "result": "int"|"bool",
 "decreases": Expr,          // int-valued over the params
 "body": Expr}               // may call itself and earlier spec_funs
```

New Expr form:

```
{"call": {"fun": ID, "args": [Expr, ...]}}
```

`fun` is a spec_fun name, or, inside the task's own body only, the task's
own name (direct self-recursion; no mutual recursion in v1). Semantics:

- A spec_fun call denotes the unique function satisfying its defining
  equation; well-definedness is exactly the termination obligation: at every
  self-call (and every call to an earlier spec_fun there is nothing to
  check), the callee's `decreases` measure evaluated at the call's arguments
  is `>= 0` and strictly less than the caller's measure at its own
  parameters. The kernel discharges this.
- A self-call of the task denotes a value about which exactly the task's
  contract is known (modular reasoning: callee `requires` must hold at the
  call site; callee `ensures` may be assumed of the result). A body that
  self-calls MUST carry a task-level `"decreases"` measure with the same
  obligation as above. Lowerings may hoist expression-position self-calls
  into call statements; the meaning is call-by-value, evaluated left to
  right, and (in v1) self-calls appear only in contexts where evaluation
  order is unobservable: specs and assignments.

The spec side of a recursive task is anchored by a spec_fun (`ensures r ==
fact(n)`), never by the task's own name: an `ensures` that referenced the
task itself would be redefined by the twin along with the body, and the flip
would measure nothing.

### Early exit (v1)

`{"return": [ID, Expr]}`, written `return Expr;`. `ID` must be the task's
return name (the AST carries it, as `assign` does, so an interpreter runs
the statement without context). It evaluates `Expr`, assigns it to the
return variable, and ends the task: no statement of its own block may
follow it (well-formedness refuses an unreachable statement), and no later
statement of any enclosing block runs. A path may end in `return` instead
of an assignment. Inside a loop, a `return` leaves the loop without owing
the loop's invariant at that point; the task owes its `ensures` there as
at every exit. Definedness rules are unchanged: `Expr` is in the same
position as an assignment's right-hand side.

Stated 2026-09-08 (ROADMAP 12.7) from the measurement that early exit is
the top gap of MBPP's Python reference solutions (62 of 974) and appears
in 138 of the 785 DafnyBench programs. Lowering status (current, all seven
`lower_*.py`; ROADMAP 12.7 landed 2026-09-09): every column lowers it.
dafny, verus, spark and framac have a return statement; lean, rocq and
fstar encode a loop as a recursive function and return an outcome (exited
with a value, or the loop state) whose invariant shape differs on the two
paths. The committed corpus carries two tasks with `return`: `is_prime`
and `first_even` (t/tasks/is_prime.json, t/tasks/first_even.json).

### Sequences as values (v1)

Stated 2026-09-09 (ROADMAP 12.7, "arrays with mutation"). Measured first
on the 785 DafnyBench programs (unwitnessed: this breakdown's run
artifact was not kept; a rerun of coverage_census.py over the same
corpus finds an array-as-seq tag of 249 under the census's current
naming, not directly comparable to the 315/157/130/72/85 split below,
which no committed table restates): 315 use an array, 157 assign an
element, 130 only read one (the lifter already carries a read-only array
as a `seq`), 72 mutate a parameter in place under `modifies`, 85 allocate an
array and fill it. Every one of those shapes is a value computation once
the array is a sequence: an in-place update is a functional update, an
allocation is a filled sequence, and a method whose effect is its array is
a task whose return is a `seq`. So t takes arrays this way, with no heap,
no aliasing and no element-level frame: a `seq` local or return is a
variable like any other, the loop frame rule havocs it by name, and what
its elements preserve across an iteration is the invariant author's
statement, as it is in Dafny with `seq` and in every functional kernel.

New Expr forms:

```
{"op": "update", "args": [SeqExpr, IdxExpr, Expr]}   // s[i := v]; DEFINED IFF 0 <= i < len(s)
{"op": "fill",   "args": [IntExpr, Expr]}            // seq(n, v): n copies of v; DEFINED IFF n >= 0
```

`update` denotes the sequence equal to `s` at every index but `i`, where it
holds `v`; its length is `len(s)`. `fill` denotes the sequence of length
`n` whose every element is `v`. `==` and `!=` now also apply to two seqs,
extensionally: equal lengths and equal elements at every index. Types:
`seq` may be declared as a return (`returns (r: seq)`) and as a local
(`var a: seq := s;`), and assigned and returned like an int. `at`, `len`,
the bounded quantifiers and the definedness rules are unchanged. What is
still not in v1: nested seqs, seqs of bools (literals, concatenation and
slices are the next section).

The lifter's mapping (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 22): `a[i] := e` becomes
`a := a[i := e]`; `new int[n]` becomes `seq(n, 0)`; a method that
`modifies a` and speaks of `old(a[..])` and `a[..]` in its ensures becomes
a task with `a` as a `seq` parameter and a fresh `seq` return, `old(a[k])`
reading as `a[k]` and post-state `a[k]` as the return's element; `fresh(b)`
on a returned array is dropped. Each lowering's dated note records the
kernel's own sequence type, its update and construction forms, and what
extensional equality costs it.

### Sequences: literals, concatenation, slices (v1)

Stated 2026-09-09 (ROADMAP 12.7, the wave after "Sequences as values").
Measured first, twice. On the 785 DafnyBench programs, 50 of the 643
gradable are blocked by sequence operations alone (unwitnessed: the
breakdown's run artifact was not kept; no committed COVERAGE-dafnybench.md
row or census rerun states this per-shape split): 28 build a sequence by
appending a singleton (`r := r + [x]`), 27 start from `[]`, 30 slice, 10
prepend a singleton, 6 concatenate two slices. On the 24,748 nl/ problems
(`COVERAGE-nl.md`), a sequence literal is needed by 8,599, concatenation
by 6,030, a slice by 3,305, and a string, the top gap at 18,361, is a
sequence of characters that needs exactly these three operations before
the character type means anything (at the census split, current,
`COVERAGE-nl.md`: seq-slice 2,474; the string figure split into
string-lib, the gap, at 13,266, and string-as-seq, the burden, at
13,339). So t takes the three on sequences of ints now, values
throughout, and the character type is the wave after.

New Expr forms:

```
{"op": "seq",    "args": [Expr, ...]}                 // [e1, ..., en]; n >= 0; [] is the empty seq
{"op": "+",      "args": [SeqExpr, SeqExpr]}          // s + t: + on two seqs is concatenation; always defined
{"op": "slice",  "args": [SeqExpr, IntExpr, IntExpr]} // s[a..b]; DEFINED IFF 0 <= a <= b <= len(s)
```

`seq` denotes the sequence of length n whose k-th element is the k-th
argument, every argument an int; with no arguments it is the empty
sequence, and `len([]) == 0`. `+` on two seqs denotes the sequence of length
`len(s) + len(t)` whose element at `i` is `s[i]` for `i < len(s)` and
`t[i - len(s)]` otherwise: one operator name, polymorphic by the types of
its operands exactly as `==` already is (two ints, two bools, two seqs). `slice` denotes the sequence of length `b - a`
whose element at `k` is `s[a + k]`; it is undefined unless
`0 <= a <= b <= len(s)`, a definedness obligation under the rules above,
exactly as `at` outside `[0, len)`. The notation also writes `s[a..]` for
`s[a..len(s)]` and `s[..b]` for `s[0..b]`; both are sugar the parser
expands, the AST carries only the three-argument form. A `+` whose operands are one int and one seq is
ill-typed, as a `==` across types is. Every argument of a literal is evaluated, so a literal is
defined iff all its elements are; a concatenation is defined iff both arguments
are. Nothing else changes: `at`, `len`, `update`, `fill`, extensional `==`
and the bounded quantifiers apply to the new values as to any seq, the loop
frame rule havocs a seq variable by name, and the interpreter's length cap
(`interp.MAX_SEQ`) bounds a literal and a concatenation as it bounds
`fill`. What is still not in v1: nested seqs, seqs of bools, membership as
an operator (`x in s` stays the lifter's bounded `exists`, decision 2),
characters and strings.

Two committed tasks carry the construct: `tail` (loop-free: a slice and a
literal, `ensures len(r) == len(s) - 1` and every element) and
`filter_pos` (a loop that appends to a seq return, `r := r + [s[i]]`, with
`len(r) <= i` and a value invariant, the LLM-shaped append idiom the census
counts). The twin ladder needs no new operator: `off-by-one` reaches a
slice bound and an appended index, `wrong-var` swaps the sequence
concatenated, `collapse-if` drops the filter's test; the fuzz family
`v1seqops` measures which of them refute, per column. Each lowering's
dated note records the kernel's own literal, append and slice forms, what
the slice's definedness obligation costs it, and, for framac, which shapes
its buffer encoding refuses (a concatenation's length is data-dependent
in a loop; an output buffer needs a caller-pinned bound, so a
seq-returning task that appends must state `len(r) <= E` for an `E` over
the parameters, or framac abstains).

The lifter's mapping (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md rows 25 to 27): a Dafny
sequence display `[e1, ..., en]` is the literal, `[]` the empty one; `+`
on two seqs is the same `+`; `s[a..b]`, `s[a..]`, `s[..b]` are the slice and
its two sugars, and `a[..]` on an array parameter (the whole array, already
a seq by decision 1) is the parameter itself.

### Strings as sequences of code points (v1)

Stated 2026-09-09, the same night as the sequence trio, and measured
first: on the 24,748 nl/ problems the top gap is `string-char` at 18,361
(`COVERAGE-nl.md`, the sole blocker for 347 function-shaped problems); on
the 785 DafnyBench programs 94 use a string or a char, 7 as their sole
gap (the census was later split, current, `COVERAGE-nl.md` /
`COVERAGE-dafnybench.md`: nl/ carries the gap as string-lib, 13,266, sole
298, with the seq-of-code-points usage measured apart as the burden
string-as-seq, 13,339; DafnyBench carries string-as-seq as a burden at
94, with the gap split into string-lib, 6, sole 0, and nested-seq-string,
4, sole 2); 14 MBPP-DFY methods are refused for it first. t adds no type and no
operator for them. A character is its Unicode code point, an int in
`[0, 1114111]`; a string is a `seq` of code points. Everything a string
does in Dafny (`seq<char>`) or in a Python test, t already does on a seq:
`len`, indexing, `+`, a slice, extensional `==`, a comparison of two
characters as ints, a bounded quantifier over positions.

What the notation adds is two literal forms, both sugar the parser
expands and the printer never emits:

```
'a'          // a char literal: {"int": 97}, the code point; escapes '\n' '\t' '\'' '\\'
"abc"        // a string literal: {"op": "seq", "args": [{"int": 97}, {"int": 98}, {"int": 99}]}; "" is []
```

The AST carries ints and seqs only, so a lowering never sees a character
and every column's existing sequence lowering covers a string; the round
trip holds on the AST (`parse(print(t)) == t`) and the canonical text
prints code points as ints. What is given up, on purpose: the char/int
type distinction. Dafny refuses `'a' + 1`; t computes 98, and a task that
wants a character to stay one states it. Lexicographic order on strings is
not an operator: a task states it with quantifiers or a spec function, as
it states any order. Not in v1: the library a Python solution leans on
(`split`, `upper`, `strip`, `join`, `format`); those are functions a task
writes, or a later gate, and the census counts them apart from the seq
shapes (`string-as-seq` the burden, `string-lib` the gap).

The lifter's mapping (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 28): Dafny `string` is
`seq`, `char` is `int`, a char literal its code point, a string literal the
seq literal, `c as int` and `i as char` the identity, and a comparison of
chars an int comparison; a Dafny char is a UTF-16 code unit unless the
program is compiled with `--unicode-char`, so a literal outside the Basic
Multilingual Plane is refused rather than guessed. MBPP tests whose
arguments or results are Python strings enter the spec experiment's pool
as code-point sequences (`mbpp_dfy.parse_assertion`), which is the pool's
version 2.

### Pairs (v1)

Stated 2026-09-09 (commit 8ee34d5; ROADMAP 12.7, the wave after strings).
The construct landed the following day, 2026-09-10 (core commit 5991e8b,
all seven kernels commit 578a473, 2026-09-10 03:03Z). Measured first,
twice. On the 785 DafnyBench programs, `multi-return` heads the census's
greedy order once the sequence trio landed: 71 gradable programs carry it,
27 are blocked by it alone, and of the 73 multi-return methods among the
parsed files 66 return two values (46 `(int, int)`, 6 `(nat, nat)`, 3 the
`(bool, int)` flag-and-value idiom, 2 `(seq<int>, seq<int>)`), 43 carry a
loop, and 26 of the `(int, int)` methods compute both values in one loop
(unwitnessed: no committed census artifact, log, or commit message states
this int-int-single-loop sub-count independent of this prose),
so the two are one coupled result and not two tasks (the shape
measurement of 2026-09-09 that settled `zero-returns` and `multi-method`
as burdens). On the 24,748 nl/ problems, `tuple` is the third gap after
strings and the string library: 7,906 problems build or unpack a tuple, 53
are blocked by it alone, while a function returning several values is 43
(the census was later split, current, `COVERAGE-nl.md`: the two-element
case landed as the burden `tuple-pair`, 7,747, and the remaining gap
`tuple` -- three or more elements, a nested tuple, or a string component
-- is 3,872, sole 56). So t takes a pair as a value. One construct serves both corpora: the
Dafny method with two returns (the lifter turns two named outs into one
pair return) and the Python tuple (a value passed, returned, compared),
and a pair of two base types is the whole of v1.

New type: `{"pair": [T1, T2]}`, each of `T1`, `T2` one of `"int"`,
`"bool"`, `"seq"`; written `(int, int)`, `(bool, seq)`. A parameter,
return or local type. Not in v1: a pair of pairs, a seq of pairs, a pair
of three.

New Expr forms:

```
{"op": "pair", "args": [Expr, Expr]}   // (a, b); a pair value; defined iff both components are
{"op": "fst",  "args": [PairExpr]}      // p.0; always defined on a pair
{"op": "snd",  "args": [PairExpr]}      // p.1; always defined on a pair
```

`pair` denotes the pair whose first component is its first argument and
whose second is its second; `fst` and `snd` project, `fst((a, b)) == a`
and `snd((a, b)) == b`. `==` and `!=` on two pairs of one type are
componentwise, the polymorphic `==` again (two ints, two bools, two seqs,
two pairs); `< <= > >=` stay int-only, so a pair has no order. A `pair`
whose operands disagree with the declared type, a projection of anything
but a pair, and a `==` across pair types are ill-typed. Nothing else
changes: the loop frame rule havocs a pair variable by name, a bound
variable is still an int, and a component obeys its own type's rules
(`len` and `at` reach a seq component through `fst` or `snd`, with the
same definedness obligations). The notation writes `(e1, e2)` for the
pair (a parenthesised expression with a comma; `(e)` alone is still
grouping) and `p.0`, `p.1` for the projections; the AST carries `pair`,
`fst`, `snd` and nothing else.

Two committed tasks carry the construct: `divmod_pair` (loop-free:
`requires y > 0`, `r := (x div y, x mod y)`, `ensures r.0 * y + r.1 == x`,
`0 <= r.1`, `r.1 < y`; twin `wrong-var`, the components swapped, refuted
at `x = 1, y = 1`, the first point of the domain's shell order that breaks
`r.1 < y`) and `min_max` (a loop over a non-empty seq that keeps
both bounds in one pass and returns `(lo, hi)`, ensures every element
between `r.0` and `r.1` and each attained; the coupled `(int, int)` loop
shape the measurement counts 26 of (unwitnessed, the same unrestated
sub-count as above); twin `collapse-if`, the first guard
collapsed, refuted at `s = [0, 1]`: no invariant drop of this task is
witnessable by bounded execution, measured at fifteen times the state
cap, so the ladder falls through to the next rung). The twin
ladder gains one move: `wrong-var` swaps the two components of a `pair`
and swaps `fst` for `snd` in a projection; `off-by-one` reaches a
component as any int. The fuzz family `v1pairs` measures which twins
refute, per column.

Each lowering uses its kernel's own product and records it in a dated
note: dafny and verus tuples with `.0` and `.1`, lean `Int × Int` with
`.1` and `.2`, rocq `Z * Z` with `fst` and `snd`, fstar `int & int`, spark
a record type declared per pair type inside the task's package, framac a
struct returned by value with `\result.a` and `\result.b` in ACSL, or a
named refusal where the memory model or a seq component costs the
certificate. The lifter's mapping (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 29): a method
`returns (a: T1, b: T2)` lifts to one return `r: (T1, T2)`, `a` and `b`
become locals, every exit returns `(a, b)`, and `a`, `b` in `ensures`
become `r.0`, `r.1`; three or more returns stay refused, by name.

### Nested sequences (v1)

Stated 2026-09-10 (ROADMAP 12.7, the wave after pairs). Measured first,
twice, and the second measurement corrected the first: the censuses' tag
`nested-seq` fires on any `seq` whose element is not an int, so of the 17
DafnyBench programs it names as blocked by nesting alone, 12 hold a
sequence of sequences of ints, 2 hold `seq<char>` (a string, in the
fragment since row 28), 2 hold `seq<bool>` (its own gap), and 1 fails to
parse for an unrelated reason; of the 74 programs it tags, 16 nest at all,
12 with int rows, 2 with string rows, none with pair rows, none three
deep. On the 24,748 nl/ problems the tag names 3,948 (821 function-shaped,
3,127 stdin): 1,470 confirmed int or bool rows, 150 string rows, 5 pair
rows, 10 three or more deep, 2,313 unreadable by static reading (grid and
matrix problems whose row type a static pass cannot fix) (unwitnessed:
this sub-count breakdown appears nowhere except this prose). (The tag was
split again the same night into `nested-seq`, `seq-of-bool`,
`nested-seq-string`, `nested-seq-deep` and `nested-seq-other`, commit
b31d583: current, `COVERAGE-dafnybench.md`, the plain int/nat `nested-seq`
burden is 12 programs, 10 sole; current, `COVERAGE-nl.md`, `nested-seq`
narrowed to int/bool rows is 3,606, sole 154.) The shapes that
dominate, none restated in any committed table besides this prose
(unwitnessed): a local matrix built and indexed in a loop (3,008 locals,
12,321 row indexes, 9,416 element indexes), a parameter consumed row by
row under a single-binder `forall` with a `len(s[i])` fact (19 parameter
sites, 26 row-length uses, 10 such foralls on DafnyBench), and a nested
literal (3 and 299). Rows are ragged by default: no DafnyBench program
states a cross-row length equality, and 157 of the 3,948 carry any
rectangular signal (unwitnessed; the 3,948 denominator is itself the
superseded first-pass count, current committed `nested-seq` is 3,606,
`COVERAGE-nl.md`). Beside it, the string library, nl/'s top gap: 13,266
current gap count (`COVERAGE-nl.md`, string-lib), of which 8,784 are said
to call `split` or `join` and nothing else in the library (unwitnessed:
the 8,784 split/join-only subset appears nowhere in COVERAGE-nl.md,
nl_census.py, or any commit message), and both return a sequence of
sequences, so this construct is the library's substrate as the sequence
trio was the string's.

New type: `{"seq": "seq"}`, a finite sequence whose elements are seqs of
ints, written `seq<seq>`; the elementary `"seq"` is unchanged and still
means a seq of ints. A parameter, return or local type. Not in v1: three
levels, a seq of strings as a distinct type (a string row is a seq of
ints already, so a `seq<seq>` holds one; the lifter's row for
`seq<string>` and `seq<seq<char>>` is the wave after), a seq of pairs, a
seq of bools.

No new Expr forms. The existing operators are polymorphic by the static
type of their operands, exactly as `+` and `==` already are: `seq` (the
literal, `[[1, 2], [3]]`, every element a seq expression, `[]` the empty
nested seq where the declared type says so), `len(s)` (the number of
rows), `at(s, i)` written `s[i]` (a row, a seq value, DEFINED IFF
`0 <= i < len(s)`), `s[i][j]` (the notation's chained postfix, `at(at(s,
i), j)`, defined iff both indices are in range), `len(s[i])`, `s + t` on
two nested seqs (concatenation of rows; appending one row is `s + [r]`),
`s[a..b]` (a slice of rows), `update(s, i, r)` (row `i` replaced by the
seq `r`), `fill(n, r)` (`n` copies of the row `r`), and `==`/`!=`
(extensional and recursive: two nested seqs are equal iff same length
and equal rows). A `+`, `update`, `fill` or literal whose element is an
int where a row is expected, or a row where an int is expected, is
ill-typed. Definedness composes: a literal is defined iff every row is,
`s[i][j]` iff `0 <= i < len(s)` and `0 <= j < len(s[i])`. Quantifiers are
unchanged: a bound variable is an int, and a quantifier over the
elements of a row is the nested single-binder form `forall i in [0,
len(s)) :: forall j in [0, len(s[i])) :: ...`, the inner bound depending
on the outer, which the checker and every column already take. The loop
frame rule havocs a nested seq by name; the interpreter's length cap
bounds the outer length and each row.

Two committed tasks carry the construct: `swap_rows` (loop-free: `r :=
update(update(m, i, m[j]), j, m[i])` under `requires 0 <= i < len(m)`
and `0 <= j < len(m)`, ensures `len(r) == len(m)`, `r[i] == m[j]`,
`r[j] == m[i]`, every other row unchanged; twin `off-by-one`, refuted at
`m = [[]], i = 0, j = 0`, the shifted index running off the single row,
the ladder's first rung with a witness) and `row_max_len` (a loop over the rows keeping the
longest length, `requires len(m) > 0`, ensures every row's length at
most `r` and some row's length equal to it, the seq_max shape over row lengths;
twin an invariant drop, refuted by exit entailment at `m = [[], [0]]`,
the dropped upper bound letting the loop exit with `r = 0`). The twin ladder needs no new move:
`off-by-one` reaches an outer or an inner index, `wrong-var` swaps two
seq-typed names, `collapse-if` and the invariant drops as before. The
fuzz family `v1nested` measures which twins refute, per column.

Each lowering uses its kernel's own nested sequence and records it in a
dated note: dafny `seq<seq<int>>`, verus `Seq<Seq<int>>`, lean `List
(List Int)`, fstar `Seq.seq (Seq.seq int)`, rocq its own seq encoding
nested one level (or a named refusal where the fn-and-length form does
not compose), spark the generic sequence package instantiated over the
sequence type, framac a named refusal or a flat buffer with an offsets
array, measured first. The lifter's mapping (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 30):
Dafny `seq<seq<int>>` and `seq<seq<nat>>` in a parameter, return or
local are `seq<seq>`; `array2<int>` (a matrix with its own indexing) and
`seq<string>` stay refused, by name. The census's `nested-seq` detector
is split the same day: `seq<seq<int>>` one level deep a burden, `seq<bool>`,
`seq<string>` in a row, and depth three or more gaps under their own
names, so the 17 reads 12.

### The string library (v1)

Stated 2026-09-11 (ROADMAP 12.7, the wave after nested sequences),
measured first: COVERAGE-string-lib.md reads the nl/ census member by
member. Of the 24,748 problems, 13,266 need the Python string library and
3,103 need nothing else t lacks: 298 function-shaped (the census's sole
blockers) and 2,805 stdin-shaped, whose need is almost only `split()` on
the input, the stdin-signature construct's own business. Over the 298 the
greedy order is split, str(), join, count, strip, format, replace,
int(x, base), rstrip, find, lower, f-strings, upper, isdigit, isalpha;
twelve members reach 240 of 298. The corpus is Python and the model
writes what it knows, so the semantics are Python's, exactly, one member
at a time, with the reference interpreter transcribing each method over
tuples of ints (never calling Python's `str` or `chr`, so it stays total on
any int) and parity with Python's own `str` methods measured by
`test_strlib.py` on 2,000 sequences per member; the kernels are measured
against it.

A string is a `seq` of code points and a list of strings a `seq<seq>`
(the two sections above); the library adds no type. It adds polymorphic
operators, each total (Python's are; the library adds no undefined case),
each with the definedness of its arguments only:

- `split(s)` : seq -> seq<seq>, Python's `s.split()`: runs of whitespace
  separate, leading and trailing whitespace is dropped, no row is empty;
  `split("") == []`. Measured 2026-09-11 (`test_strlib.py`'s parity test):
  "whitespace" is the 10 ASCII code points Python's own `str.isspace()`
  holds for, 9-13 and 28-32 (FS/GS/RS/US alongside tab/LF/VT/FF/CR/space),
  not the 6-point guess an earlier draft of this line named; a `chr()`-
  free interpreter still has to enumerate them, since it never calls
  `str.isspace()` itself (interp.py's own note on why).
- `split(s, c)` : seq, int -> seq<seq>, Python's `s.split(chr(c))` on one
  code point: every occurrence separates, empty rows kept, so
  `len(split(s, c)) == count(s, [c]) + 1` and `join(split(s, c), [c]) == s`.
- `join(rows, sep)` : seq<seq>, seq -> seq, Python's `sep.join(rows)`.
- `tostr(n)` : int -> seq, Python's `str(n)`: decimal digits, `-` at 45
  for a negative n.
- `count(s, t)` : seq, seq -> int, Python's `s.count(t)`: non-overlapping
  occurrences left to right; `count(s, []) == len(s) + 1`.
- `find(s, t)` : seq, seq -> int, Python's `s.find(t)`: the least index
  where t occurs, `-1` when none, `find(s, []) == 0`.
- `strip(s)`, `lstrip(s)`, `rstrip(s)` : seq -> seq, whitespace as above
  removed at both ends, the left, the right.
- `replace(s, t, u)` : seq, seq, seq -> seq, Python's `s.replace(t, u)`:
  every non-overlapping occurrence left to right; `t == []` inserts `u`
  before every code point and at the end, as Python does.
- `lower(s)`, `upper(s)` : seq -> seq, the ASCII letters 65 to 90 and 97
  to 122 mapped, every other code point unchanged (the corpus is ASCII;
  the Unicode case tables are not in v1, by name).
- `isdigit(s)`, `isalpha(s)`, `isupper(s)`, `islower(s)` : seq -> bool,
  Python's on the ASCII classes: `isdigit` iff s is non-empty and every
  code point is 48 to 57; `isalpha` iff non-empty and every code point a
  letter; `isupper` iff at least one letter, every letter upper; `islower`
  likewise.
- `startswith(s, t)`, `endswith(s, t)` : seq, seq -> bool.

In the notation every member is written Python's way, `s.split()`,
`s.split(c)`, `sep.join(rows)`, `s.count(t)`, `s.find(t)`, `s.strip()`,
`s.replace(t, u)`, `s.lower()`, `s.isdigit()`, `s.startswith(t)`, and
`tostr(n)` as a function; the JSON op is the member's name with the
receiver first (`{"op": "split", "args": [s, c]}`), `s.split()` and
`s.split(c)` two arities of one op. A member in specification position is
the same function (its value in a quantified body or an ensures), so an
ensures may say `len(s.split(c)) == s.count([c]) + 1`. Twin operators
apply to a member's arguments as to any expression; no member-specific
twin exists in v1.

Not in v1, each by name and by the census: `format` and f-strings (a
desugaring to `tostr` and `+` is the lifter's, not the language's),
`int(x, base)` and string-to-int parsing (with the stdin-signature
construct), `strip(s, chars)` and the two one-sided chars forms,
`split(s, t)` on a multi-code-point separator, `splitlines`, the padding
members (`zfill`, `center`, `ljust`, `rjust`), the case members that need
word boundaries (`title`, `capitalize`, `swapcase`), `partition`, and
`encode`. Each kernel lowers a member to a definition in its prelude, a
recursive function with the lemmas its own proofs need, measured on the
committed tasks, the fuzz family `v1strlib`, and the spec experiment's
pool, which grows by the function-shaped problems whose only gap these
members close; the per-kernel notes record what each kernel proves about
a member and what stays an abstain, by name.

Tasks, twin and witness measured via `harness.twin_cached` (2026-09-11),
correcting the twins predicted when this section was first drafted:
`word_count` (`r := len(t2.split())` over `t2 := s[0..len(s)]`, a
full-length slice standing in for the loop-free body's own copy of `s`;
twin OFF-BY-ONE on the slice's `0` lower bound, witness `s = []`, real
`0`, twin undefined -- `slice bounds [1..0]`), `split_join` (the law
`[c].join(s.split(c)) == s` as an ensures, the body rebuilding `s` by the
law with a decoy `s.strip()` local also in scope; twin WRONG-VAR, `s`
becomes `trimmed` inside the rebuild, witness `s = [32]` (one space),
`c = 0`, real `[32]`, twin `[]`), and `count_vowels` (a loop over code
points, invariant `r == s[0..i].count([97]) + ... + s[0..i].count([117])`
against the five lowercase vowels; twin INVARIANT-DROP on that
invariant, witness `s = []`, exit state `i = 0, r = 1` violating the
now-unconstrained `ensures`).

### The string library (v2)

Stated 2026-10-06, the string library's second wave, measured first
(receipt 608b2fa22b76): after the fourth landing's census corrections,
`string-lib` is a gap on 1,288 problems, the largest language item left,
and the members the corpus uses beyond the first wave are, in order,
`split(sep)` with a longer or variable separator, `index`, `format`,
`strip`/`rstrip` with a character set, `translate`, `capitalize`,
`swapcase`, `center`, `rfind`, `zfill`, `rjust`, `ljust`, `splitlines`,
`isspace`, `isalnum`, `title`, `partition`. The semantics stay Python's,
exactly, transcribed over tuples of code points as the first wave's were
and measured against Python's own methods by `test_strlib.py`:

- `split(s, t)` : seq, seq -> seq<seq>, Python's `s.split(t)` on a
  sequence separator: non-overlapping occurrences left to right separate,
  empty rows kept; DEFINED IFF `len(t) > 0` (Python refuses an empty
  separator). The same op as `split(s, c)` on one code point, told apart
  by the second argument's type.
- `strip(s, t)`, `lstrip(s, t)`, `rstrip(s, t)` : seq, seq -> seq, the code
  points of `t` removed at both ends, the left, the right (`t == []`
  removes nothing, as Python does).
- `index(s, t)` : seq, seq -> int, `find(s, t)`; DEFINED IFF `find(s, t) >=
  0` (Python raises).
- `rfind(s, t)` : seq, seq -> int, the greatest index where `t` occurs,
  `-1` when none; `rfind(s, []) == len(s)`.
- `zfill(s, w)` : seq, int -> seq, `s` padded on the left with `0` (48) to
  width `w`, a leading sign (43 or 45) kept in front; `s` itself when
  `len(s) >= w`.
- `center(s, w)`, `ljust(s, w)`, `rjust(s, w)` : seq, int -> seq, and with a
  third int argument the fill code point (32 when omitted); `center`
  puts `(w - len(s)) div 2 + (if both w - len(s) and w are odd then 1 else
  0)` fills on the left, Python's own split.
- `capitalize(s)`, `swapcase(s)`, `title(s)` : seq -> seq, on the ASCII
  letters: the first code point upper and the rest lower; every letter's
  case swapped; a letter after a non-letter (or first) upper and a letter
  after a letter lower.
- `isspace(s)`, `isalnum(s)` : seq -> bool, non-empty and every code point
  whitespace (the ten of `split`), or a letter or digit.
- `splitlines(s)` : seq -> seq<seq>, the rows between line boundaries (10,
  13, the pair 13 10 as one, 11, 12, 28, 29, 30, 133, 8232, 8233); a
  trailing boundary ends the last row without opening an empty one;
  `splitlines([]) == []`.
- `partition(s, t)` : seq, seq -> (seq, seq, seq), the part before the
  first occurrence of `t`, `t`, the part after; `(s, [], [])` when `t` does
  not occur; DEFINED IFF `len(t) > 0`.
- `isint(s)` : seq -> bool, an optional sign (43 or 45) then one or more
  digits; `toint(s)` : seq -> int, the integer written, DEFINED IFF
  `isint(s)`; `toint(tostr(n)) == n`. Both are library names, written as
  calls like `tostr`.

Every member keeps the first wave's notation, `s.member(args)`, and the
JSON op is the member's name with the receiver first; `strip`,
`lstrip`, `rstrip`, `split` and the three padding members gain a second
arity. Not in v2, by name: `format` and f-strings, `translate` and
`maketrans`, `encode`, `expandtabs`, `splitlines(keepends)`,
`split(sep, maxsplit)`, `rindex`, `removeprefix`/`removesuffix`, and the
Unicode case tables (ASCII, as in v1).

**The lowerings.** Dafny and Verus carry every member in their preludes,
recursive functions in the first wave's style with the ensures the
committed tasks need (a padded length, a stripped length no greater than
the input's and smaller when the first code point is stripped, `rfind`'s
bounds); F*, SPARK, Lean, Rocq and Frama-C abstain by name on the second
wave until built and measured. The hand-back writes Python's own methods
through the same transcriptions.

**The committed tasks:** `pad_right_len` (`s.ljust(w)`: the length is
the larger of `len(s)` and `w`), `swap_prefix` (`s[0..n].swapcase()`: the
length is `n`), `last_pos` (`s.rfind(t)`: between -1 and `len(s)`, room
for `t` when found, `len(s)` for an empty `t`), `strip_dots`
(`s.strip([46])`: no longer than `s`, shorter when `s` starts with a dot).

### Methods (v1)

Stated 2026-09-26 (t/FEATURES-TRACK.md, feature 1). Copied from Dafny's
methods and call statement (Dafny reference manual, sections 6.3 "Method
Declarations" and 8.5.2 "Method call with out-parameters", and its
verification chapter: "Dafny works modularly, meaning that each method is
considered by itself, using only the specifications of other methods"),
restricted to one return as a task is.

A new optional top-level field, v1 only:

```
"methods": [ {"name": ID,
              "params":  [ {"name": ID, "type": Type}* ],
              "returns": [ {"name": ID, "type": Type} ],   // exactly one
              "requires": [ Expr* ],
              "ensures":  [ Expr+ ],
              "decreases"?: Expr,       // required iff the body self-calls
              "body": [ Stmt+ ]}, ... ]
```

Written, between the task's clauses and its body, beside `spec fun`:

```
method max2(x: int, y: int) returns (m: int)
  ensures m >= x and m >= y
  ensures m == x or m == y
{ if x >= y { m := x } else { m := y } }
```

Rules (check_wf's `method-*` keys):

- **Names.** A method's name is distinct from the task's, every
  spec_fun's and every other method's. `method` is contextual in the
  notation (a variable may still be called `method`).
- **Scope and typing.** A method is checked exactly as a task is: its
  `requires` sees its params, its `ensures` its params and return, its
  body its params, return and locals; a `return` in its body names its own
  return; its params are not assignable.
- **Order.** A method body may call the spec_funs, every EARLIER method,
  and itself when the method carries a `decreases` (the task's own
  self-recursion rule, Gate 3). The task body may call every method. No
  mutual recursion, as for spec_funs.
- **Call position.** A method call is the whole right-hand side of an
  `assign` or a `var` init, and its arguments call no method (Dafny 8.5.2:
  "the result of a method call is not allowed to be used as an argument
  of another method call, as if it were an expression"). A method call in
  a spec (a `requires`, `ensures`, spec_fun body, invariant or
  `decreases`), a guard, a `return` or inside any other expression is
  ill-formed. This is stricter than a task self-call, which may sit in any
  strict body position and is hoisted; the strict form is what every
  kernel's call statement already is, so no lowering hoists anything.

Semantics:

- **Verification is modular.** Each method is verified against its own
  contract, separately (each lowering emits it as its own function or
  procedure in the same file). At a call `x := m(e1, ..., en)` the caller
  owes `m`'s `requires` at the arguments and then knows exactly `m`'s
  `ensures` of the result `x`: nothing about `m`'s body. A caller whose
  proof needs more than the callee promises does not verify, even when
  the callee's body would have made it true
  (`t/methods_probe/opaque_callee.t` is that probe).
- **Execution is by value.** The interpreter (`interp.funs_of`) runs the
  callee's body on the argument values and returns its result. A call
  whose callee `requires` is false at the arguments is undefined (the
  value witness vocabulary's "undefined", as for `at` out of range),
  never a value.
- **The twin never mutates a method.** Methods join `requires`,
  `ensures` and `spec_funs` as the fixed instrument; only the task body is
  broken, and a twin's calls go to the same, unmutated methods.

Lowering status (2026-09-26, all seven `lower_*.py`): every column lowers
methods, each as its own contract-carrying definition verified in the same
file, with the body hidden from callers (natively in Dafny, Verus, Frama-C;
`Hide_Info` in SPARK, `opaque_to_smt` in F*, `irreducible` plus the spec
theorem in Lean, a callee bound as a function variable with its contract in
Rocq). On the fixtures `t/methods/*.t` all seven verify every real except
Rocq's `rev_twice` (timeout) and refute every twin except Dafny's `count_pos`
(an undefined-index witness, no Dafny certificate); every kernel reads
`t/methods_probe/opaque_callee.t` unproved. Each column's named abstentions
and the per-kernel table are in `t/FEATURES-TRACK.md`.

### Lemmas (v1)

Stated 2026-09-27 (t/FEATURES-TRACK.md, feature 2). Copied from Dafny's
lemma (Dafny reference manual, section 6.3.3 "Lemmas"): a ghost method
with no return, whose `requires`/`ensures` are the statement proved, whose
body is the proof, and whose call statement gives the caller the ensures
at the arguments once the caller has shown the requires there. Lemmas are
erased when a Dafny program is compiled; in t a lemma call is a no-op at
run time.

A new optional top-level field, v1 only, and one new statement:

```
"lemmas": [ {"name": ID,
             "params":  [ {"name": ID, "type": Type}* ],
             "requires": [ Expr* ],
             "ensures":  [ Expr+ ],
             "decreases"?: Expr,      // required iff the body calls the lemma itself
             "body": [ LemmaStmt* ]}, ... ]      // its proof; may be empty
LemmaStmt: {"if": {...}} over LemmaStmts | {"lemma": {"name": ID, "args": [Expr*]}}
         | {"assert": Expr}                       // a proof step; lemma bodies only
Stmt (new): {"lemma": {"name": ID, "args": [Expr*]}}
```

Written, beside `spec fun` and `method`:

```
lemma sum_append(a: seq, lo: int, hi: int)
  requires 0 <= lo and lo <= hi and hi < len(a)
  ensures sum_range(a, lo, hi + 1) == sum_range(a, lo, hi) + a[hi]
  decreases hi - lo
{ if lo < hi { sum_append(a, lo + 1, hi); } else { } }
```

and called as a statement, `sum_append(s, 0, i);`, anywhere a statement may
stand in the task body, a method body or a loop body.

Rules (check_wf's `lemma-*` keys):

- **Names.** A lemma's name is distinct from the task's, every spec_fun's,
  every method's and every other lemma's. `lemma` is contextual in the
  notation, as `method` is.
- **Scope and typing.** The lemma's `requires`, `ensures`, `decreases` and
  body see its params only. Its contract may call spec_funs, never a
  method or a lemma.
- **The body is a proof skeleton.** Only `if`, `assert` and lemma calls:
  the case split, the intermediate facts and the induction step of a Dafny
  lemma. No assignments, locals, loops or returns (a lemma has no state
  and no result). `assert e;` (written so, contextual; allowed only inside
  a lemma body) is a proof step: a kernel that states it must prove it
  from what precedes it, and may then use it; a kernel that cannot place a
  cut in its encoding (SPARK's expression functions) leaves it out, which
  only removes a hint. Its calls name EARLIER lemmas, or the lemma itself
  when it carries a `decreases` (Dafny's own well-founded recursion for an
  inductive proof); no mutual recursion.
- **Call position.** A lemma call is a whole statement. A lemma is never
  called inside an expression, and the call's arguments call no method.

Semantics:

- **A lemma is proved in the file that uses it, never assumed.** A
  lowering either proves every lemma in the file (a kernel that cannot
  prove one reads the whole file unproved) or states none of them and
  proves the program without their help; nothing a lemma states is ever
  used unproved, so no lowering of a lemma can make a wrong program or a
  sabotaged twin verify.
- **A call gives the caller the lemma's ensures at the arguments.** In
  Dafny, Verus, SPARK and Frama-C this is the kernel's own call rule for
  a lemma, proof fn, Boolean lemma function or ghost function, and the
  caller owes the lemma's `requires` at the call. F* and Lean have no call
  statement inside their functional encoding of a t body: there each
  proved lemma is handed to the automation with a trigger (an F* `SMTPat`,
  a Lean `grind_pattern`) over the spec_fun calls in its ensures, so its
  conclusion is available wherever those terms occur and its hypotheses
  can be shown. That adds only proved facts; the one difference is that a
  call whose requires is false is not rejected there. Rocq (2026-09-27)
  proves each lemma as a theorem of the file (a recursive one by induction
  on a nat fuel bounding its `decreases`, the encoding its spec_funs and
  self-recursive tasks already have) and poses the call's instance, the
  theorem applied to the arguments as rendered in the symbolic state at
  the call, in the proof whose goal covers that statement; a premise
  (a `requires`) is discharged where its automation proves it and left in
  place as an implication otherwise, so a call whose requires is false
  gives nothing. Where its lowering has no site for the instance (a
  self-recursive body, nested or multiple loops) it states none of the
  lemmas and proves the program with the calls removed, as it did in v1.
- **Execution.** The interpreter skips a lemma call. The twin never
  mutates a lemma and never mutates a lemma call's arguments (the ladder
  breaks only assignments, locals, returns and guards). A twin's
  refutation certificate replays what the twin executes, so every
  certificate walk skips the call too.

Lowering status (2026-09-27, all seven `lower_*.py`): Dafny a `lemma`
(always with a body; a body-less Dafny lemma is an axiom); Verus a `proof
fn` (recursive spec fns revealed to fuel 2 in its proof, a nonlinear step
proved by `nonlinear_arith` from the requires, guards and earlier steps on
its path); SPARK a Boolean function with Pre/Post, its call in the
value-neutral obligation wrapper (left out in a body with an early return,
whose escape threading has no path guard for the Pre); Frama-C a ghost C
function with an ACSL contract and a ghost call; F* a `Lemma` with an
`SMTPat`; Lean a theorem closed by grind with a `grind_pattern`; Rocq
(2026-09-27, `t/lower_rocq.py`'s LEMMAS section) a theorem per lemma
proved from the skeleton by the file's own automation, fuel induction for
a recursive one, each call's instance posed in the enclosing proof; a body
shape with no site for it states none and proves the program with the
calls removed.

Fixtures `t/lemmas/*.t` (pow2_pos: an inductive lemma over a recursive
spec_fun; sum_loop: an induction step used inside a loop; sq_bound: a
nonlinear arithmetic fact) and seeded-fault probes `t/lemmas_probe/*.t`
(false_lemma: an inductive lemma false at its base case; false_arith: a
false nonlinear fact; circular: a lemma that "proves" `k == k + 1` by
calling itself on the same argument; false_assert: a true lemma whose
proof asserts a false step, around a correct program; false_nonlinear_step:
the same with a false nonlinear step under a guard). Per-kernel verdicts are in
t/FEATURES-TRACK.md.

### Finite sets (v1)

Stated 2026-09-27 (t/FEATURES-TRACK.md "The features ahead: 9. Finite
sets"). Measured first, on the 1886 staged Dafny files of the 2026-09-26
lift with the merged lifter (the round-2 census,
`t/FEATURES-CLOUD-2026-09-27-r2.md`): 77 methods refuse `set`, in three
shapes -- 39 the cardinality of a bounded comprehension, `|set i: int | 0
<= i < |s| && P(s[i])|`, used as a count in an `ensures` (humaneval
018/026/064/069/073/098/108/126 and the vericoding `solve`s); 30 a display,
`s[i] in {'G', 'T', '.', '#'}`; 8 a `set<int>` parameter or return
(`common(l1, l2) returns (c: set<int>)`, built up by a loop). So t takes a
finite set of ints as a value, with the six operations every kernel's own
library states directly; the comprehension is the wave after (below).

The lifter's own mapping of Dafny's `set<int>` onto this type landed
2026-09-27 (LIFTER-DECISIONS row 52, t/FEATURES-TRACK.md Done 15): a
`set<int>` parameter, return or local; a display `{e1, ..., en}`/`{}`
whose every element is int-typed; `in`/`!in`; `|s|` to `card`; and
Dafny's `+`/`*`/`-` between two sets to `union`/`inter`/`diff`. Measured
on the same 1,886 staged files (a later census snapshot found 83 methods
refusing `set`, not 77 -- see row 52 for the discrepancy): 7 now lift, all
seven a display, none a typed-name method -- a typed-name method's own
realistic spec (`forall x :: x in c ==> P(x)`) needs a set as a
quantifier's own range, which stays out of v1 (below), so the yield is
well under the 38-method upper bound this section first estimated. Of the
7, 3 pass the check stage; graded in all seven kernels, one (`month in
{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`) is clean in dafny/verus/f\*, an honest abstain in
SPARK/Frama-C/Lean, and unproved in rocq (a real gap, not an abstention),
the other two vacuous (an unsatisfiable `requires` in the bounded probe
domain, unrelated to sets); 4 fail the check stage on an unrelated
character/string lemma. See row 52 for the full count.

New type: `"set"`, a finite set of ints, written `set`. A parameter,
return or local type. Not in v1: a set of bools, seqs or pairs, a set as a
pair component or as a seq element, a set-typed spec_fun parameter or
result, a set as a quantifier's range, and the comprehension `set i | lo
<= i < hi && P(i)` (its predicate needs a binder every kernel would have to
close over; it is stated separately when it lands, as a defunctionalised
predicate, so that SPARK and Frama-C can name it).

New Expr forms:

```
{"op": "set",   "args": [Expr, ...]}          // {e1, ..., en}; the set of the values; {} the empty set
{"op": "in",    "args": [IntExpr, SetExpr]}   // x in s; membership
{"op": "card",  "args": [SetExpr]}            // card(s); the number of elements
{"op": "union", "args": [SetExpr, SetExpr]}   // union(s, t)
{"op": "inter", "args": [SetExpr, SetExpr]}   // inter(s, t)
{"op": "diff",  "args": [SetExpr, SetExpr]}   // setminus(s, t); the elements of s not in t
```

`set` denotes the set of its arguments' values, so duplicates collapse:
`card({1, 1}) == 1`, and `{}` is the empty set. `in` is membership, `card`
the number of elements (a non-negative int), `union`, `inter` and `diff`
the usual operations. Every one of the six is TOTAL: a display is defined
iff every element is, and the other five iff their operands are; the
library adds no undefined case, as the string library adds none. `==`
and `!=` on two sets are extensional (the same members), the polymorphic
`==` again; `< <= > >=` stay int-only, so a set has no order and v1 has
no subset operator (`card(setminus(s, t)) == 0` says it). An `in` whose left
operand is not an int or whose right is not a set, a `card` of a non-set,
a `union`/`inter`/`diff` on anything but two sets, and a display with a
non-int element are ill-typed; so is `+`, `-` or `*` on a set (t writes the
operations by name, never by overloading the arithmetic symbols, so the
notation stays unambiguous without a type). Nothing else changes: the loop
frame rule havocs a set variable by name, a bound variable is still an
int, and a quantifier ranges over `[lo, hi)` as before, so "every element
of `s` satisfies P" is written over a seq of candidates or as `card(inter(
s, ...))`, never over the set itself.

The interpreter's value is a finite set of ints (Python's frozenset,
shown as its sorted list in a witness); the domain ladder for a set-typed
name is the seq ladder's tuples read as sets, duplicates collapsed, so the
near corner (the empty set, then singletons) comes first. The twin ladder
needs no new move: `wrong-var` swaps two set-typed names, `off-by-one`
reaches an int inside a display or a `card` comparison, `collapse-if` and
the invariant drops as before. The fuzz probes `fz_p_set_*` in
`t/fuzz_lower.py` state the six operations' laws (duplicates collapse,
inclusion-exclusion, `diff` against `inter`, extensional equality, an
adversarial union count) and a loop that builds a set from a seq.

Each lowering uses its kernel's own finite set and records it in a dated
note: dafny `set<int>` (display, `in`, `|s|`, `+`, `*`, `-`); verus
`vstd::set::Set<int>` in proof code (`set![..]`, `contains`, `len` under
`finite`, `union`, `intersect`, `difference`); fstar `FStar.FiniteSet.Base`
(`mem`, `cardinality`, `union`, `intersection`, `difference`, with
`FStar.FiniteSet.Ambient` for the SMT); rocq Stdlib 9.2's `MSetList.Make
(Z_as_OT)` (`mem`, `cardinal`, `union`, `inter`, `diff`, `equal`); spark
`SPARK.Containers.Functional.Sets` over `Big_Integer` (`Contains`,
`Length`, `Union`, `Intersection`; the library has no difference function,
so `diff` is a named refusal there until one is built and proved); lean
(core, no Mathlib, which has no finite set) and framac (C has no set
value) a named refusal, measured first, or a sorted duplicate-free list
proved equivalent. A kernel that cannot state an operation soundly
abstains by name; none totalises or approximates it.

**Set difference is spelled `setminus`, not `diff` (2026-09-27, same day).**
A review found `diff` was a common variable and return name: 4 documents of
the proved corpus and 7 lifted task files under `t/out/lifted-tasks-*/`
named a return or local `diff`, and every one stopped parsing the moment
`diff` became a keyword (`t/FEATURES-TRACK.md` "11. Finite sets" carries the
measurement). `set`, `card`, `union` and `inter` collide with nothing in
the corpus and stay reserved by name, the same named-operation style as
`len`, `tostr` and `fill`; `set` also opens the type-name production a
`var x: set` declaration needs before it would try a user name, and
`card`/`union`/`inter` are resolved by keyword before the parser would try
a generic call, so freeing them would trade one collision for another kind
of ambiguity, not remove one. `diff` had no such need -- it was simply
spelled the same as an English word already in use -- so only its surface
spelling changed, to `setminus`; the AST op tag stays `"diff"` (every
lowering, `check_wf` and `interp` read the tag, never the surface word, so
none of them changed). `t/loop_locallm.py`'s corpus builder gained the
guard that was missing: it now refuses, by name and with the parse error,
any document about to be written that does not parse with the current
surface, rather than writing it and letting a downstream reader (`t_tool`,
`locallm/chat_data.py`) drop it silently.

### Seq-valued spec_funs (v1)

Stated 2026-09-27 (t/FEATURES-TRACK.md "The order from here": the binding
refusal for string programs). Measured first: of the 2026-09-26 lift of the
1,886 staged Dafny files, 135 methods failed on a helper function returning
a `string` or a `seq<int>`, refused `function-result` since 2026-09-27
(t/FEATURES-CLOUD-2026-09-27.md, "Strings, the binding gap"); 25 of the 37
nested-string lifts and 8 of the 17 tuple refusals hit it. A spec_fun's
result was int or bool; every string program with a helper that builds a
string stopped there.

Gate 3's SpecFun gains one result type:

```
{"name": ID, "params": [...], "result": "int"|"bool"|"seq",
 "decreases": Expr, "body": Expr}
```

`"seq"` is the elementary seq of ints, the same type a parameter, return or
local already has (a string is a seq of code points, "Strings as sequences
of code points (v1)"). The body is a seq expression: a literal, a slice, a
concatenation, an `update`/`fill`, a string-library member, an `ite` over
seqs, a call of a seq-valued spec_fun (itself included), or a seq parameter.
Nothing else changes: a call `f(args)` of a seq-valued spec_fun is a seq
expression wherever an int-valued call is an int expression (`requires`,
`ensures`, invariants, other spec_fun bodies, the task body), so it may be
indexed, measured (`len`), sliced, concatenated and compared with `==`/`!=`
(extensionally) as any seq; the definedness rules of those operators apply
to the result exactly as to a seq variable (`f(s)[i]` is DEFINED IFF
`0 <= i < len(f(s))`). Well-definedness is still the termination obligation
of gate 3, unchanged; a seq-valued spec_fun's body carries the same
definedness obligation an int-valued one does (its `at`/slice/`div` sites
are defined under the body's own path conditions). Not in v1: a nested seq
result (`{"seq": "seq"}`), a pair result, a bool-seq result; check_wf
refuses them by name (`spec-fun-result`).

The notation writes the result type as it writes a parameter's:
`spec fun dbl(s: seq, n: int): seq decreases n = ...`.

The twin ladder needs no new rung: the twin never touches a spec_fun, and a
task body that builds a seq under an invariant stated through the spec_fun
(`invariant r == dbl(s, i)`) already offers the ladder its moves. The
committed task `double_all` (t/tasks/double_all.t: `dbl(s, n)` is the
first `n` elements doubled, the loop appends `2 * s[i]` under `r ==
dbl(s, i)`, ensures `r == dbl(s, len(s))` and `len(r) == len(s)`) draws
`compare-flip` on the loop guard, refuted at `s = []` where the twin reads
`s[0]`. The probes `fz_p_sf_seq_*` (t/fuzz_lower.py) cover a result that
is measured, indexed, sliced and built in the body, and one false ensures
through a seq-valued spec_fun (expected refuted); since the 2026-09-27
review, two more plant the fault in the spec_fun's own body (`dbl`
prepending where the loop appends; `tl` dropping the last element where
the body drops the first), expected refuted.

The refutation certificate (dafny and F*, the two columns that state a
witness as a ground lemma the kernel must accept) ladders every seq-valued
spec_fun call its formula reaches, callees first, and every ground seq
operator around it, each asserted equal to the interpreter's literal
before the certificate's own goal (lower_dafny.py, certificate step 3;
lower_fstar.py `_seq_rungs`). Without the rungs both kernels read the two
seeded faults unproved, not refuted: Dafny unfolds a recursive function
only to its default fuel, and neither kernel relates a literal to a ground
append with no index term to trigger on. The rungs are hints the kernel
re-proves; a task whose certificate reaches no seq-valued call gets none,
so every committed lowering is unchanged.

Frama-C's own certificate carries the same idea in ACSL, since 2026-09-27
(`_cev_seqval`/`_CEV_TRACE_SEQ`/`_seq_call_lhs` in lower_framac.py): every
seq-valued spec_fun call the certificate's ground replay reaches is
asserted equal to its own ground `\list<integer>` value (`\Cons(v0,
\Cons(v1, ..., \Nil))`), callees before callers, kept entirely separate
from the pre-existing int/bool ladder (a different pair of globals, its
own flush) so a task with no seq-valued spec_fun is byte-identical.

Lowering status (2026-09-27; verdicts on the fixtures in
t/FEATURES-SEQFUN-2026-09-27.md): six kernels state the construct with
their own sequence type in the function's signature, exactly as they state
an int result (Dafny `function f(..): seq<int>`, Dafny Reference Manual
6.4; Verus `spec fn f(..) -> Seq<int>`, the Verus guide's spec functions;
SPARK an expression function returning the functional `Seq`; Lean `def
f_s .. : List Int` with `termination_by`; Rocq a fuel Fixpoint returning
the file's own `((Z -> Z) * Z)` function-and-length pair, read back by
`fst`/`snd` at a call (the representation `lower_rocq.py`'s 2026-09-09
note chose over `list Z`); F* `let rec f .. : Tot (Seq.seq int)
(decreases m)`). Frama-C, since 2026-09-27 (t/FEATURES-SEQFUN-2026-09-27.md
"Frama-C, the \list route"): a seq-valued spec_fun is a recursive ACSL
logic function returning `\list<integer>` (ACSL's own built-in
constructors `\Nil`/`\Cons` and its own `\concat`, kernel_internals/
typing/logic_builtin.ml -- WP's Vlist.ml gives all three, plus `\nth`/
`\length`, a native decision procedure, not a user axiom), the same
recursive-`logic`-equation shape this file already gives an int/bool
result. Every `==`/`len`/`at` site where a buffer-typed seq value meets
such a call bridges through ACSL's own `\length`/`\nth` directly
(`_seq_len_render`/`_seq_at_render`/`defs`'s own `call` cases): no
separate bridge PREDICATE is declared, since `\length l`/`\nth l k`
already relate `l` to whatever a buffer's own `_n`/index expression is
compared against. A slice of a real buffer inside such a body converts
through one more recursive helper (`t_seq_of_range`, structurally total,
so it needs no termination lemma to be sound); the append/prepend facts
a one-element-at-a-time recursive step needs (`T_SEQ_LIST_LEMMAS_ACSL`)
are proved once, from ACSL's own list theory, not assumed. What the
route does not reach (a seq-typed spec_fun PARAMETER passed through
unchanged, `update`/`fill` inside such a body, anything outside a
literal/`+`/`ite`/call/slice-of-buffer) still abstains by name. Measured
(the desktop, CPU only, frama-c 33 / alt-ergo 2.4.3): every twin this
pass tested refutes (double_all, the four `fz_p_sf_seq_*` probes with a
twin, and the three faults seeded into a spec_fun's own body for this
pass); on the real side, `fz_p_sf_seq_at` verifies outright and the rest
read an honest `unproved`/`timeout` (WP/alt-ergo's own automation gap
combining the recursive unfolding with a loop-carried or slice-derived
`\list` fact under the task's other hypotheses, not a soundness gap).
The lifter's mapping is LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 49.

### Datatypes (v1)

Stated 2026-09-27 (FEATURES-TRACK.md "10. Datatypes", the census's biggest
remaining sole-blocker group: 73 methods refused `datatype` at classify,
plus 56 files the parser refuses on `match`; round 2 named the shapes
`datatype-enum`, `-record`, `-sum`, `-real`, `-generic`, `-recursive`, and
`match-literal`). This landing states the first of them, in the order
FEATURES-TRACK.md set: **enumerations**, a datatype whose constructors
carry no fields (Dafny `datatype Color = Red | Green`, Dafny Reference
Manual 5.14 "Algebraic Datatypes"/5.14.1 "Inductive datatypes"; Rust
Reference "Enumerations", a field-less/"unit-only" enum; Lean's "Theorem
Proving in Lean 4" ch.7.1 "Enumerated Types", `inductive Weekday where |
sunday | ...`). Records (one constructor, int/bool/seq fields) and
non-recursive sums are the next two v1 waves FEATURES-TRACK.md orders
after this one; recursive datatypes stay out of v1 and refuse by name,
permanently for now (a recursive constructor needs a well-founded
interpreter value and a termination measure on top of everything below,
neither built).

**The value.** A datatype is declared once per task, a name and an
ordered, non-empty list of constructor names, each carrying zero fields in
this landing:

```
"datatypes": [{"name": "Color", "ctors": [{"name": "Red"}, {"name": "Green"}]}]
```

Its value (`interp.Ctor`, a frozen dataclass of `dtype`, `ctor`, `args`,
`args` always `()` this landing) is a closed, ordered list of nullary
constructors, exactly what all three cited designs treat a field-less sum
as: Dafny's own words, a set of constructors; Rust's own words, "a
field-less enum"; Lean's own words, "a type with a finite, enumerated list
of elements". `dtype` is part of the runtime value, not only of the static
type, the same reasoning `Pair` needed no type tag for (interp.py's own
note): two different datatypes may reuse a constructor name (Dafny allows
this too, disambiguated by qualification), so a bare tag by constructor
name alone could not tell `Color.Red` from some other datatype's own
`Red`. `==`/`!=` are the same polymorphic operator every other value type
already has, now structural over a datatype value's `(dtype, ctor)` pair
(interp.py's dataclass equality, `Ctor(...) == Ctor(...)`); a datatype has
no order, so `< <= > >=` on one is ill-typed, checked before a `Ctor` value
could ever reach one, exactly the pair/set precedent.

New type: `{"datatype": D}` where `D` names one of the task's own
`datatypes` declarations. A parameter, return or local type. Not in v1: a
datatype as a pair component, a seq element, a set element, or a spec_fun
parameter/result (SPEC_FUN_RESULTS stays int/bool/seq); a datatype
declared by one task and used by another (there is no such thing --
`dtypes`, check_wf's per-task lookup table, is built fresh from
`task["datatypes"]` every call).

New Expr forms:

```
{"ctor": {"dtype": D, "name": C, "args": [...]}}       // D.C; a value; "args" always [] this landing
{"match": {"scrutinee": Expr, "arms": [{"ctor": C, "binders": [...], "body": Expr}, ...]}}
```

`ctor` denotes the value built by constructor `C` of datatype `D`; defined
iff every field argument is (vacuously true this landing, `args` is always
empty, kept general for the record wave). `match` is Dafny's own construct
(reference manual 5.14, "match expression"/8.5.2): **total**, one arm per
constructor of the scrutinee's own datatype, each exactly once (check_wf's
`match-coverage` rule proves the bijection between the arms' `ctor` names
and the datatype's declared ones; a match with a missing or repeated
constructor is refused before it ever reaches the interpreter or a
lowering). `match`'s own type is its arms' common type (check_wf's
`match-branches` rule: every arm must agree); definedness is the
scrutinee's own AND the definedness of whichever arm's body the
scrutinee's actual constructor selects (interp.py's `ev`, and
`lower_verus.py`'s `defined()`/`lower_lean.py`'s `dcond()`, both state this
by reusing `match` ITSELF as the branching construct in the obligation
formula, exact because the coverage proof already makes it exhaustive --
the same move `ite`'s two-branch definedness case already makes). A record
match (SPEC.md's next wave) is field access, stated when records land; a
match over a datatype's constructors is what v1 has, not an if-chain a
printer writes back (FEATURES-TRACK.md's original phrasing named an
if-chain as an alternative notation for an all-boolean-result match; this
landing states `match` as its own AST form instead, since every one of the
three cited designs gives datatypes a real case-split construct and a
printed if-chain would need the same total-coverage proof `match` already
states, with none of Dafny's/Rust's/Lean's own name for it).

**What is not in v1.** A datatype as a pair/seq/set component or a
spec_fun signature type; field-carrying constructors (records, the next
wave); more than one constructor with fields (non-recursive sums, the wave
after); a recursive constructor (permanently out of scope for now, no
termination measure built for one); a match whose scrutinee is anything
but a plain datatype value (no nested match-of-match pattern beyond what
composing two `match` Exprs already gives); a datatype-typed loop-havoc
value undergoes no special treatment -- the frame rule havocs it by name
like any other variable, unchanged.

**The frame rule.** Unaffected: a `while` loop havocs a datatype-typed
variable by name exactly as it does a pair or a set (SPEC.md "The frame
rule"); nothing about the construct interacts with the loop gate.

**The twins.** The ladder gains one move, `swap-ctor` (harness.py
`_c_swap_ctor`): two of a `match`'s arms trade BODIES (their `ctor`/
`binders` stay put), so a twin computes arm B's value when given
constructor A and vice versa -- "swaps two constructors" read as "swaps
what two constructors mean", the enum analogue of `wrong-var`'s pair-
component swap (which itself reads as "swaps the two components", not
"swaps which projection runs"). Every unordered pair of arms is tried,
since a match may have more than two constructors. `harness.py`'s generic
expression walk (`_sub`, `_exprs`) was extended to descend into a `ctor`'s
field arguments and a `match`'s scrutinee and arm bodies, so every
EXISTING rung (`off-by-one`, `wrong-var`, ...) also now reaches into a
match arm's body for free -- measured: `off-by-one` alone already refutes
`fz_p_dt_match_total`'s canonical twin (bumping one arm's literal), and
`swap-ctor` independently refutes all three of its own candidates for the
same task (3 of 3, `interp.Reference.refuting_witness`). Four probes state
the construct's laws in `fuzz_lower.py`'s families (`fz_p_dt_match_total`/
`_bad`, `fz_p_dt_eq`, `fz_p_dt_match_eq`): a total match reading back each
constructor's own code, its hand-written swap-ctor twin refuted, structural
equality stated both as membership and disequality, and a match tied to
plain equality.

**Lowering status (2026-09-27).** Three of seven kernels state the
construct end to end, matched to what "Finite sets (v1)" measured first as
well (three of seven, then a fourth later): dafny (a native `datatype`
declaration and `match` expression, the source construct itself -- measured,
`dafny verify`, 1 verified / 0 errors on `fz_p_dt_match_total`, 0 verified
/ 2 errors refuting its swap-ctor twin by hand-checking the postcondition
directly). Through the actual grader (`run_par.py`/`verifiers/dafny.py`,
both untouched by this landing), dafny's own committed cell reads
`verified / unproved`, not `verified / refuted`: `verifiers/dafny.py`'s
refutation-certificate shape check (`_HONEST_KINDS = ("function", "method",
"lemma")`) refuses a certificate in a file that also declares a
`datatype`, so the one door to a minted REFUTED never opens for this
construct, an honest structural gap in the certificate's allowed
vocabulary rather than a soundness gap -- the twin's own measured witness
(SPEC.md "The twins") is genuine and the postcondition genuinely fails
under `dafny verify` (measured directly, `0 verified, 1 error` on the
whole file, `1 verified, 0 errors` on the certificate lemma ALONE under
`--filter-symbol=t_refutation_certificate`), but the grader's own gate
holds it to `unproved`, recorded here rather than routed around (AGREEMENT.md's
own note on the `color_code` row). verus (a Rust `enum` with
`#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]`, `use Dtype::*;` so a `match`'s arms print as
bare variant names -- measured, `verus`, 1 verified / 0 errors on the real
body, 0 verified / 1 postcondition error alongside the accepted refutation
certificate on the twin, both in `proof fn` position with no additional
attribute; `run_par.py`'s own grade of `color_code` reads `verified /
refuted`); lean (an `inductive ... deriving
DecidableEq`, `match ... with | .C => ...` using Lean 4's own anonymous-
constructor dot notation in match position -- measured, `lean`, the real
body's `grind`-closed spec theorem prints a clean axiom list, the twin's
own spec theorem depends on `sorryAx` (grind correctly cannot close a false
goal) while its hand-built refutation certificate (SPEC.md "The twins")
depends on no axioms at all -- REFUTED, and `run_par.py`'s own grade of
`color_code` agrees). SPARK, Rocq, F* and Frama-C
abstain by name (`NotImplementedError` at the top of each `lower()`, before
any other work runs): each has a design FEATURES-TRACK.md or this file
names (Ada enumeration types for SPARK; Rocq's own `Inductive` with the
same measured-cost posture its finite-set wave already logged; F*'s own
`type D = | C1 | C2 | ...`; Frama-C through a tagged struct with an ACSL
exhaustiveness predicate, since C's `enum` is an unchecked int with no WP
support of its own for a case split), unbuilt and unmeasured against their
own kernels this landing, named honestly rather than guessed at. The
lifter's own mapping (source-side admission of Dafny `datatype`/`match`
into this shape) is LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 53, which this landing leaves
open: `lift_classify`/`lift_parse` still refuse every method and file the
2026-09-27 census counted for `datatype`/`match`, unchanged.

**Byte identity.** Every task/lemma/nested file committed before this
landing carries no `"datatypes"` field, and every new code path above is
gated on `task.get("datatypes")` (the four abstaining lowerings) or on a
`"ctor"`/`"match"` key no pre-existing AST ever carries (check_wf, interp,
the lowerings that DO state the construct, the twin ladder's `_sub`
extension): sha256 of every committed task's, lemma's and nested file's
lowered source, real and twin, in all seven kernels, is unchanged from
before this landing (588 = 42 files x 7 kernels x 2 sides, byte for byte).

### Datatypes (v2): fields

Stated 2026-10-07 (`internal/RESEARCH-2026-10-07-zoom-out.md` decision 4, G9; PREDICT T23). v1's
constructors carried no fields. v2 lets them carry fields, which gives **records** (one constructor) and
**non-recursive sums** (several constructors, any of them with fields). The designs are:
- Dafny's named constructor parameters and destructors (Dafny Reference Manual 5.14.1);
- Rust's tuple-like enum variants (the Verus guide, "Datatypes: enums");
- Lean's constructors with arguments (Theorem Proving in Lean 4, 7.2).

Recursive datatypes are the next wave and are still refused by name.

**Surface.**

```
datatype Shape = Circle(r: int) | Rect(w: int, h: int) | Dot
datatype Point = Point(x: int, y: int)          // a record: one constructor, named like its datatype or not
```

- `Shape.Rect(2, 3)` builds a value. Its arguments are positional, one per declared field.
- `case s { Circle(r) => ..., Rect(w, h) => ..., Dot => ... }` binds each arm's fields positionally, under
  names the arm chooses.
- `s.w` reads a field.

**AST.** A constructor declaration gains `"fields": [{"name": f, "type": T}, ...]`. A field-less constructor keeps
v1's shape and has no `fields` key, so every v1 task is unchanged. One new Expr:

```
{"field": {"of": Expr, "name": f}}                     // e.f
```

**Types (check_wf).**
- `ctor-field-type`: a field is an int, a bool or a seq. A field whose type is a datatype, the datatype's own
  included (recursion), is refused by name.
- `field-dup`: a field name appears at most once per constructor.
- `field-unknown`: `e.f` needs `e` to be a datatype value and `f` to be a field some constructor of that datatype
  declares.
- `field-type-clash`: constructors that share a field name give it one type, which is the type of `e.f`.
- v1's `ctor-arity`, `ctor-argtype` and `match-arity` now count and type the declared fields.

The v1 gate `ctor-fields-not-v1` is lifted.

**Meaning.**
- `e.f` is Dafny's destructor. It is defined iff `e` is defined and was built by a constructor that declares `f`,
  and its value is that field.
- A match arm's binders are the chosen constructor's fields, in declaration order.
- Equality stays structural: the datatype, the constructor and every field.
- `interp.funs_of` records each datatype's field names under `funs["$fields"]`, so `ev` reads a field by position.

**The twins.** The witness ladder enumerates constructors with fields. Each field takes values from the near
corner of its own type's ladder (`DT_FIELD_NEAR = 3`: the first three ints, the bools, the first three seqs). The
combinations go in shell order, at most `DT_CTOR_CAP = 12` per constructor. A witness shows a value as
`D.C(a, ...)` in t's own notation, with a bool field as `true` or `false`. `surface.parse_expr` reads it back, as
every lowering's certificate does. Field access is a
mutation site, so every existing rung reaches it. `swap-ctor` is unchanged.

**Lowering status (2026-10-07).** Three of the seven kernels state the construct end to end.
- **Dafny:** a native `datatype` with named parameters and the `.f` destructor.
- **Verus:**
  - Rust tuple variants, `C(int, ...)`.
  - `e.f` is a `match` that returns `vstd::pervasive::arbitrary()` for a constructor without `f`.
  - The discriminator is a definedness obligation, so that value is never observed where the obligation holds.
  - A variant named like its datatype is qualified (`Point::Point`), because a glob import of it is ambiguous
    (E0659).
  - An enum with a seq field derives nothing. Spec-mode `==` is structural for every type, and vstd's `Seq`
    implements no `PartialEq`. v1's `#[derive(PartialEq, Eq)]` stays wherever it compiles.
- **Lean:**
  - An `inductive` whose constructors take named binders.
  - `e.f` is a `match` with a `default` arm only when some constructor lacks `f`.
  - A match whose arms carry a quantifier is a Prop-valued match, so the quantifier stays logical.
  - A loop whose contract has such a match states its lemma through a named predicate `{name}_t_post`, which the
    preservation step's `split` does not look inside.
  - A product over a match binder gets no top-level sign lemma. After a case split, the sign rule those lemmas
    use closes it.

In all three, the certificate reads a datatype witness back through the parser, and a value witness may be a
datatype. A field or a match binder named like a kernel's keyword is renamed with its uses (`names.py`), as every
other identifier is. SPARK, Rocq, F* and Frama-C refuse every datatype by name, as in v1.

**Byte identity.** Every lowering of the 88 committed tasks and the 21 AlgoVeri tasks was compared before and
after this landing: real and twin, in all seven kernels, with the twin's witness (1,320 and 315 entries). All are
byte-identical.

**Not in v2.**
- A recursive constructor, or any field of datatype type.
- A generic datatype.
- A datatype as a pair, seq or set component.
- A datatype in a spec_fun's signature.
- Field update (Dafny's `e.(f := v)`).
- Field access in the Python hand-back, which refuses datatypes by name, as in v1.

### Datatypes (v3): recursion

Stated 2026-10-07 (G10, PREDICT T25). A constructor field may have the type of its own datatype, or of a datatype
declared before it, which gives trees. Spec functions, lemmas and self-recursive tasks may then recurse on such a
value, with the value itself as the measure. The designs:
- Dafny's inductive datatypes, ordered by structure (Reference Manual 5.14.1);
- Verus's decreases-to relation, in which a datatype decreases to its potentially recursive fields (Verus
  reference, `decreases_to!`);
- Lean's recursor and structural recursion (Theorem Proving in Lean 4, ch. 7).

AlgoVeri's tree, trie and segment-tree contracts need this wave. Their set-valued helpers are a separate one.

**Surface.**

```
datatype Tree = Leaf | Node(v: int, l: Tree, r: Tree)
...
task tree_sum(tr: Tree) returns (s: int)
  ensures s == total(tr)
  decreases tr
spec fun total(q: Tree): int
  decreases q
= case q { Leaf => 0, Node(v, l, r) => v + total(l) + total(r) }
{
  s := case tr { Leaf => 0, Node(v, l, r) => v + tree_sum(l) + tree_sum(r) };
}
```

**Types (check_wf).**
- `ctor-field-type` now admits a field of the datatype's own type or of a datatype declared before it. Every other
  type outside int, bool and seq is still refused by name. A datatype declared later is refused by the parser, which
  knows only the names declared so far. Mutual recursion is not in this wave.
- `datatype-base`, new: some constructor has no field of the datatype's own type. Otherwise no value is finite,
  and the witness ladder could not name one.
- A spec function's or a lemma's `decreases` may be a datatype value as well as an int
  (`spec-fun-decreases-int`, `lemma-decreases`). A task's own `decreases` already had no type rule.

**Meaning.** A recursive call must take a value structurally below its measure: a field the arm's match bound.
The kernels check this, each by its own order. The interpreter's opt-in measure check compares sizes
(`interp.ctor_size`, the number of constructors), which every structural descent lowers.

**The twins.**
- **Ladder:** the witness ladder builds recursive values in rounds (`DT_DEPTH = 2`). Each round draws a recursive
  field from the values so far, so a tree ladder holds `Leaf`, three one-node trees and nine two-level trees,
  smallest first.
- **New wrong-var move:** a match arm's binder is read as another binder of the same field type (a tree's `l` for
  its `r`). It comes after every existing move, so no earlier task's twin changes. It is binders only: a
  parameter in a recursive call's place would not terminate.

**Lowering status (2026-10-07).** Three of the seven kernels state the construct end to end.
- **Dafny** declares the datatype natively. A self-call inside a `case` or `if` on an assignment's right-hand side
  is lowered as a `match` or `if` statement, each arm hoisting its own calls, since a binder exists only in its arm
  and an untaken branch's call is never evaluated. A constructor's arguments are strict, so a self-call among them
  is hoisted too. The certificate check admits a datatype field that names another datatype declaration in the
  same program.
- **Verus:**
  - A datatype field is a `Box<D>`, built with `Box::new`.
  - An arm binds a boxed field under a fresh name and reads it as `let b = *t_box_b;`. Verus accepts a recursive
    call on such a value under `decreases`, and rejects one on the `Box` itself (E0308).
  - A self-call inside a spec function's argument is bound by a `let` first, because a proof fn call in spec
    position is a mode error.
- **Lean:**
  - A recursive spec function or task with a datatype measure has no termination clause, so Lean elaborates it by
    structural recursion. Its kernel then evaluates it at a ground witness (`decide`).
  - The contract is proved by `induction` on the measure parameter, generalizing the others, then closed by grind
    with the function equations.
  - A measure that is not a parameter, and a structurally recursive task with a `requires`, are refused by name.

SPARK, Rocq, F* and Frama-C refuse every datatype by name, as in v1.

**Byte identity.** Every lowering of the 94 committed tasks and the 22 AlgoVeri programs was compared before and
after this landing: real and twin, all seven kernels, with the witness. All are byte-identical.

**Not in v3.**
- Mutual recursion.
- A recursive datatype inside a seq, pair or set.
- Set-valued spec functions over trees in Lean, which has no sets.
- A structurally recursive Lean task with a `requires`.
- Recursion whose measure is a datatype expression other than a parameter.

### Compositional types (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06 (the operator's direction of that morning: t is the ceiling,
and the language comes first). Measured first: `t/nl_census.py` over the
24,748 problems of `nl/` (`t/COVERAGE-nl.md`, re-run 2026-10-06 on the
language as it stands) has 772 of 4,239 function-shaped problems in t's
fragment, 263 of 974 MBPP. Of what keeps the rest out, four gaps are one
gap: `tuple` (3,872 problems: three or more elements, a nested tuple, a
tuple with a string component, a list of tuples), `nested-seq` (3,606: a
seq whose rows are ints or bools, or a subscript of a subscript the census
cannot classify), `nested-seq-pair`/`-string`/`-deep` (566, 119, 95) and
`set` beyond ints (part of 1,604), with `multi-return` (43) the tuple
return. Each is t's type grammar being a FIXED LIST: `int`, `bool`, `seq`
(of ints), `(T1, T2)` of base types, `seq<seq>` one level, `set` of ints, an
enumeration. The kernels t lowers to all have products of any arity and
collections over any element type (Dafny's tuples and `seq<T>`/`set<T>`,
Verus's tuples and vstd `Seq<A>`/`Set<A>`, Lean's right-nested `Prod` and
`List`, Rocq's `prod` and `list`, F*'s `tuple2`..`tuple14` and `list`,
SPARK's records and arrays, ACSL's structs and arrays; the three kernel
pages fetched 2026-10-06 are in the receipt). So t's types become an
algebra.

**The type grammar.** A t TYPE is one of:

```
Type ::= "int" | "bool"
       | "seq"                       // a seq of ints: the canonical spelling of seq<int>
       | {"seq": Type}               // a seq of any element type; {"seq": "seq"} is seq<seq<int>> as before
       | {"pair": [Type, Type]}      // a pair of ANY two types (a pair of pairs, a pair holding a set)
       | {"tuple": [Type, Type, Type, ...]}   // three or more components, any types
       | "set"                       // a set of ints: the canonical spelling of set<int>
       | {"set": Type}               // a set of any element type
       | {"datatype": Id}            // as before
```

Two spellings would be two normal forms, so the plain strings stay the
canonical forms of the shapes they already name: `{"seq": "int"}` and
`{"set": "int"}` are refused by `check_wf` as non-canonical (the printer
never emits them, the parser never produces them), and `{"tuple": [T1,
T2]}` is refused in favour of `{"pair": [T1, T2]}`. Every committed task
is therefore valid byte for byte, and `parse(print(t)) == t` keeps one
normal form per type. Written: `seq` (`seq<int>` is NOT a spelling),
`seq<bool>`, `seq<seq>`, `seq<seq<seq>>`, `seq<(int, int)>`, `(int, seq,
bool)`, `((int, int), seq)`, `set`, `set<seq>`, `set<(int, int)>`. A
quantifier's bound variable is still an int over a range: the element
of a `seq<T>` is reached as `s[i]`, of a set by membership. A
spec_fun's parameters and result may be any type (the former
`SPEC_FUN_RESULTS` list of three is gone); a method's and a lemma's
already were.

**Values and operators.** No operator is new except two, and every
existing one is polymorphic by the static type of its operands, exactly
as `==` and `+` already were:

```
{"op": "tuple", "args": [Expr, Expr, Expr, ...]}   // (e1, ..., en), n >= 3; a value defined iff every component is
{"op": "proj",  "args": [TupleExpr, {"int": k}]}    // e.k, 0 <= k < n, k a literal; always defined on a tuple
```

`pair`, `fst` and `snd` stay the forms for two components (`(e1, e2)`,
`.0`, `.1` on a pair print and parse as they did); on a tuple of three or
more, `.k` is `proj`. A `seq` display `[e1, ..., en]` takes elements of
any ONE type and is a `seq` of that type (`[]` takes the expected type as
before, a plain `seq` where none is expected); `len`, `at`, `slice`,
`update`, `fill` and `+` work on a `seq<T>` for every `T` with the element
type `T` where an int stood (`update(s, i, v)` wants `v: T`, `fill(n, v)`
gives a `seq<T>`, `at` gives a `T`), with the definedness rules unchanged
(`at` and `update` in `[0, len)`, `slice` in `0 <= a <= b <= len`, `fill`
for `n >= 0`). A `set` display `{e1, ..., en}` takes elements of any one
type and is a `set` of that type (`{}` takes the expected type, a plain
`set` where none is expected); `in` wants `(T, set<T>)`; `card`, `union`,
`inter`, `setminus` work on any one set type. `==` and `!=` on two values
of one type are structural and extensional at every depth (two seqs of
pairs are equal when the same length and equal pair by pair); `< <= > >=`
stay int-only. The string library stays on `seq` (of ints) and `seq<seq>`
(of int rows): a `seq<bool>` has no `split`. A `+`, `update`, `fill`,
display, `in`, `==` or projection whose operand types disagree is
ill-typed, by name, in `check_wf`.

**The frame rule, definedness, scope.** Unchanged: a loop havocs the
variables its body assigns, whatever their types; a component of a
compound value obeys its own type's definedness through the projection or
index that reaches it; a bound variable is an int.

**The twins.** `wrong-var` keeps its moves and gains their generalisation:
two components of one `tuple` or `pair` display of the SAME type are
swapped (the swap of two components of different types would be
ill-typed and is not a twin), `fst`/`snd` are exchanged only when the
pair's two component types are equal, and a `proj` index moves to another
component of the same type. `off-by-one` reaches an int anywhere inside a
display, `wrong-var` swaps two names of any equal declared type (the
comparison is on the type's JSON, as it always was). The witness ladders
(`interp.ladders`) are compositional: a `seq<T>` ladder is built from `T`'s
ladder in shell order over short lengths, a tuple's from its components'
ladders as the pair's is, a `set<T>` from `T`'s seq ladder with duplicates
collapsed, each capped as the pair ladder is capped, so the near corner
(small values, short seqs) still comes first and a committed task's
documented witness is unchanged (the `int`, `bool`, `seq`, `seq<seq>`,
`(T1, T2)` of base types and `set` ladders are byte for byte what they
were).

**Each lowering** prints a type recursively in its kernel's own words and
builds and projects with the kernel's own product: Dafny `(T1, T2, T3)` and
`.2`, `seq<T>`, `set<T>`; Verus the tuple, `Seq<T>`, `Set<T>`; Lean the
right-nested product with `.2.1`-style projections, `List T`, its set
encoding over `T`; Rocq `prod` (left-nested as written) with `fst`/`snd`
chains, `list T`, its set encoding; F* `tuple3`..`tuple14` with `._1`..,
`list T`, `FStar.FiniteSet` over `T`; SPARK a record declared per tuple
shape and an array type declared per seq shape inside the task's package;
Frama-C a struct per tuple shape and the offsets encoding of
`DESIGN-framac-nested-seq.md` per seq shape. A kernel whose encoding is not
yet written for a shape abstains WITH THE SHAPE NAMED (AGENTS rule 2), and
`AGREEMENT.md` says which; the landing's registration
(`t/PREDICT-2026-10-06-t-expansion.md`, T1 and T8) counts tasks only where
every present kernel verifies the real and refutes the twin.

**The committed tasks** (each verified and its twin refuted in the kernels
that carry the shape, named in `AGREEMENT.md`): `sort3` (`(int, int, int)`
returned in ascending order from three ints: the triple), `zip_pairs` (a
`seq<(int, int)>` built by a loop from two seqs of one length: the seq of
pairs), `signs` (a `seq<bool>` of which elements are non-negative: the seq
of bools), `words_seen` (a `set<seq>` of the distinct words of a string: the
set of strings), `swap_ends` (a pair of pairs, `((int, int), (int, int))`,
with its outer components exchanged: the nested pair), `grid_row_sums`
(the row sums of a `seq<seq>` as a seq, unchanged shapes but written over
the new typing, a control). The lifter's mapping: a method with three or
more returns lifts to one tuple return (LIFTER-DECISIONS.md row 29 widened
from pairs); a Dafny `seq<(int, int)>`, `seq<bool>`, `set<string>` lifts
to the type of the same shape; `nl_census.py`'s `tuple`, `nested-seq*`,
`multi-return` and `set` detectors stop reporting what is now in the
fragment, which is how the landing is measured.

### Exact rationals (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the second landing of the expansion. Measured first: after
the compositional types, `real` is the gap with the most function-shaped
problems blocked by it alone (297 of the 4,239 in `t/COVERAGE-nl.md`; a float
literal, true division, `math.sqrt`, `float()`, or a decimal-valued test
value), and MBPP's own greedy order opens with it: 278 → 640 of 974 problems
in fragment, 65.7%. Of the seven kernels, six carry exact rationals and
proved a `1/2 + 1/2 == 1` lemma on this desktop on 2026-10-06 (Dafny `real`,
SPARK `Ada.Numerics.Big_Numbers.Big_Reals`, Frama-C's ACSL `real`, Lean's
`Rat`, Rocq's `QArith`, F*'s `FStar.Real`); Verus has no reals. The three
interface pages fetched (F*'s `FStar.Real.fsti`, Ada 2022 A.5.7, Dafny's
types chapter) are in the receipt.

**The number.** `real` is the type of exact rationals, not of floating
point: a number a program in t writes is a finite decimal or a quotient of
integers, every operation below is exact, and `==` is equality of rationals.
That is what the kernels' reals are (Z3's theory of reals, Big_Real's
numerator and denominator in lowest terms), what a specification means by
`r == x / 2.0`, and what a float would silently break (`0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3`
holds here). What this type is NOT for is stated once: IEEE floating point
with its rounding is a different gate, and a problem whose answer depends
on rounding is not posed in t. `math.sqrt` is not in this landing: a root
is stated in a specification (`r * r == x and r >= 0.0`) and computed on
integers as `isqrt` (the next landing's library).

**The type and the literal.** A new base type `"real"`, written `real`,
usable wherever `int` is (a param, return, local, component, element,
spec_fun parameter or result). A new literal:

```
{"rat": [n, d]}     // the rational n / d, with gcd(|n|, d) == 1 and d >= 1; written as a finite decimal: 1.5, 0.125, 3.0, -2.5
```

The notation writes a real literal with a decimal point and at least one
digit on each side (`3.0`, never `3.` or `.5`); the parser reduces it to
lowest terms, and the printer writes the shortest finite decimal expansion
back (`{"rat": [3, 2]}` is `1.5`, `{"rat": [-5, 2]}` is `-2.5`). A `rat`
whose denominator is not of the form 2^a 5^b has no finite decimal and is
refused by `check_wf` as non-canonical (such a value arises only as an
expression, `1.0 / 3.0`, never as a literal). As with ints, `-1.5` is the
negative literal and `-(1.5)` is `neg` of the positive one. A real literal
after a dot is never read: `p.0.1` is two projections, since a projection's
receiver is never a bare number (the lexer reads `d+.d+` as one token only
when no `.` precedes it).

**Operators.** No new symbol in the notation; the existing ones are
polymorphic by the static type of their operands, as `+` and `==` already
were, and an int and a real never meet without the conversion being written:

```
+ - * neg          real × real → real, as int × int → int; int × real is ill-typed
/                  real × real → real, EXACT division, UNDEFINED at a zero divisor (the AST op stays "div": the type decides;
                   on ints it is Euclidean, as before); % on reals is ill-typed
< <= > >= == !=    real × real → bool
{"op": "toreal", "args": [IntExpr]}    // real(x); total; written real(x)
{"op": "floor",  "args": [RealExpr]}   // the greatest int <= x; total; written floor(x)
{"op": "ceil",   "args": [RealExpr]}   // the least int >= x; total; written ceil(x)
```

`floor` and `ceil` are the two conversions back; `round` is not a form
(Python's rounds half to even, Dafny has none: a task writes `floor(x +
0.5)`). `abs`, `min`, `max` are the next landing's library and come for
both types at once. Definedness: `/` owes `y != 0.0`, through the rules of
"Definedness" exactly as `div` does; everything else here is total. A real
is a value with no order among reals and ints: `1 == 1.0` is ill-typed,
`real(1) == 1.0` is true.

**The twins.** `off-by-one` reaches a real literal as it reaches an int one
(`n / d` becomes `(n + d) / d`, the literal plus one, and minus one), and
`compare-flip`, `boundary-swap`, `wrong-var`, `wrong-constant` and
`wrong-operator` apply with no new move. The interpreter's values are
Python's `fractions.Fraction` (exact); the witness ladder for a `real`
parameter is the int ladder's values taken as reals together with the
halves, thirds and quarters between them and each literal's neighbours at a
half (`_real_ladder`), near first, so a witness is a short decimal when one
exists. A witness value is shown as `n/d` in lowest terms.

**Each lowering.** Dafny: `real`, the literal as a Dafny real literal
(`1.5`, or `(n as real) / (d as real)` for a quotient with no finite
decimal in a certificate), `/`, `x as real`, `.Floor`, and `ceil` as
`if x.Floor as real == x then x.Floor else x.Floor + 1` (the same
function as `-((-x).Floor)`, which Dafny's solver could not settle beside
a second `.Floor` within 60 s on `floor_ceil`, measured 2026-10-06; the
conditional form proves it in under a second). F*: `FStar.Real` (`+.`, `-.`, `*.`, `/.` whose divisor is
refined non-zero, which is exactly the definedness obligation, `<.` and
the rest, `of_int` for `real(x)`), a literal as its decimal with the `R`
suffix (`1.5R`; a negative one as `0.0R -. 1.5R`, since `-.` is binary; a
certificate's quotient with no finite decimal as `of_int n /. of_int d`).
`real` is erasable and its comparisons are props, so a task that uses it
is lowered in the Ghost effect (as a set task is) and a comparison or
equality in a computational position is its ghost decision
(`strong_excluded_middle`); a real certificate is discharged by the SMT
theory of reals, not by `assert_norm`. Measured 2026-10-06 (F*
2026.08.30): the four committed shapes verify and the unguarded `a /. b`
fails the divisor's refinement. `floor` and `ceil` are not in
`FStar.Real`, so a task using them abstains by name. SPARK:
`Ada.Numerics.Big_Numbers.Big_Reals` (`Big_Real`; `"/"` with its own `Den /=
0`, which gnatprove reads as "divide by zero might fail" on an unguarded
division, exactly the definedness obligation; `To_Big_Real` for `real(x)`;
a literal `n/d` as the quotient `To_Big_Real (Big_Integer'(n)) /
To_Big_Real (Big_Integer'(d))`, which gnatprove reads as the rational it
is, measured 2026-10-06: `1/10 + 2/10 = 3/10` proved), `floor`/`ceil`
abstain by name (A.5.7 has neither). Verus (no reals), Lean (core only: `Rat` exists but no
decision procedure for it is wired here yet), Rocq (`QArith` is the
encoding to write next) and Frama-C (no executable rationals: the ACSL
`real` is logic-only) ABSTAIN with `real` named. The lifter's mapping:
Dafny's `real` and its literals to `real` and `rat`; Python's `float` and
`/` in the census to this type, so `real` stops being a gap where the
program uses no rounding (the census detectors say which).

**The committed tasks:** `average` (the mean of a non-empty seq of ints as a
real: `ensures r * real(len(s)) == real(total(s, len(s)))`), `half_way`
(the midpoint of two reals, `ensures r - a == b - r`), `floor_ceil`
(`floor` and `ceil` of a real as a pair, `ensures real(r.0) <= x`, `x <=
real(r.1)`, `real(r.1) - real(r.0) <= 1.0`), `safe_ratio` (`a / b` under
`if b != 0.0`, else `0.0`, with `ensures b != 0.0 ==> r * b == a`; the
collapse-if twin computes `a / b` unguarded, so the definedness obligation
at `b == 0.0` is what refutes it).

### The library (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the third landing of the expansion. Measured first:
after the two landings above, the burdens `builtin-math` (`min`, `max`,
`sum`, `abs`: 6,624 problems) and `sort` (2,908) and `comprehension`
(5,920) are what the writer stumbles on, and the gaps `seq-slice-negative`
(489 problems, 41 blocked by it alone), `seq-slice-step` (852, 77 alone)
and `sqrt` (192, 23 alone) are what still keeps function-shaped problems
out (`t/COVERAGE-nl.md`). This section is the integer and sequence
library and the notation for it; `for` as sugar over `while`, seq
comprehensions, `sorted` and the slice step follow it as their own
landing. The provers' own libraries were fetched first (receipt
54355043298c): Dafny's `Std.Math` (`Min`, `Max`, `Abs`) and
`Std.Collections.Seq` (`Reverse` with its two ensures), Why3's `int.mlw`
(`Abs`, `MinMax`, `Power` with `power x 0 = 1` and `power x (n+1) = x *
power x n`, `Sum` by recursion over a range), Verus's `vstd` (`min`,
`max`, `abs`, `Seq::contains`, `sort_by` with its multiset lemma), F*'s
`FStar.Math.Lib` (`abs`, `max`, `min`, `powx`), Ada 2022 A.5.6
(`Min`, `Max`, `abs`, `**`, `Greatest_Common_Divisor` with `L /= 0 and R
/= 0` as its precondition), Rocq's `BinInt` (`Z.min`, `Z.max`, `Z.abs`,
`Z.pow` with `n^m = 0` for `m < 0`, `Z.sqrt` with `s*s <= n < (s+1)*(s+1)`,
`Z.gcd`) and Lean's `Nat.gcd` (`if m = 0 then n else gcd (n % m) m`).

**Names, not keywords.** A call `f(a, ...)` whose name is none of the
task's own name, its spec_funs, its methods or its inline helpers is a
library function; a declared one of the same name shadows it, as in
Python, and a variable may carry any of these names (`abs`, `gcd`, `max`
and `rev` are committed task names already). The notation needs no new
keyword and the grammar no new rule: the parser reads the call, and the
resolution to the operator below is part of parsing, so the printed form
`min(a, b)` reads back as the same AST.

**The functions.** Each is an operator in the AST (`{"op": NAME, "args":
[...]}`), written as a call:

```
min(a, b), max(a, b)   int x int -> int, real x real -> real (never mixed); total
abs(x)                 int -> int, real -> real; total
sum(s)                 seq -> int, seq<real> -> real: sum([]) == 0, sum(s) == sum(s[0..len(s) - 1]) + s[len(s) - 1]; total
gcd(a, b)              int x int -> int, Euclid on absolute values: gcd(a, 0) == abs(a), gcd(a, b) == gcd(b, a % b) for b != 0
                       (the Euclidean `%` of "Division and modulo"); total, gcd(0, 0) == 0, the result is never negative
pow(a, n)              int x int -> int: pow(a, 0) == 1, pow(a, n) == a * pow(a, n - 1) for n > 0; UNDEFINED for n < 0
isqrt(n)               int -> int: the r >= 0 with r * r <= n < (r + 1) * (r + 1); UNDEFINED for n < 0. In a kernel with no
                       square root it is defined by recursion: isqrt(0) == 0, isqrt(n) == (let r == isqrt(n - 1) in
                       if (r + 1) * (r + 1) <= n then r + 1 else r)
x in s                 T x seq<T> -> bool: exists i. 0 <= i < len(s) and s[i] == x; total (the set form stays as it was;
                       the type of the right operand decides)
rev(s)                 seq<T> -> seq<T>: len(rev(s)) == len(s) and rev(s)[i] == s[len(s) - 1 - i]; total
```

Rocq's convention `n^m = 0` for a negative exponent is not adopted: t
states undefinedness (an obligation `n >= 0`, through the rules of
"Definedness" exactly as `div` owes `y != 0`) rather than a value. Ada's
`Greatest_Common_Divisor` refuses a zero argument; t's `gcd` is total and
that lowering guards the call. `sum` over an empty seq is `0` (or `0.0`).

**The notation's sugar.** A negative literal index or slice bound written
directly as `-k` counts from the end: `s[-k]` is `s[len(s) - k]`,
`s[a..-k]` is `s[a..len(s) - k]` and `s[-k..b]` is `s[len(s) - k..b]`.
The expansion happens at parse time, the AST holds the expanded form and
the printer writes it expanded, so no kernel sees a negative index; a
variable index is never wrapped (`at` is defined on `0 <= i < len(s)` and
nowhere else), which is where Python's and t's readings part. The raw
literal `-k` as an index, an access undefined on every seq (the fuzz probe
`fz_p_at_neg` carries one), is spelled `s[(-k)]`: the parentheses keep it
out of the sugar, and that is how the printer writes such an AST, so the
round trip holds for both.

**The twins.** WRONG-OPERATOR gains one move: `min` and `max` swap. Every
other rung applies with no new move (OFF-BY-ONE and WRONG-CONSTANT reach a
literal argument, WRONG-VAR an argument of the same type, COLLAPSE-IF a
guard around a partial call). The interpreter evaluates every function
above exactly (Python's own `min`, `max`, `abs`, `sum`, `math.gcd`, `**`,
`math.isqrt`, `in`, reversal), raising `Undef` where this section says
UNDEFINED.

**Each lowering** emits a definition for each function the task uses,
named `t_` plus the function, once per file, and uses the kernel's own
where it has one: Dafny (`t_min`/`t_max`/`t_abs` as `Std.Math` writes
them, over `real` too; `t_sum`, `t_pow`, `t_isqrt`, `t_gcd` recursive with
`decreases`, `t_isqrt` carrying its ensures; `in` is Dafny's own seq
membership; `t_rev` as `Std.Collections.Seq.Reverse` with its two
ensures), Verus (`spec fn`s of the same shapes, `s.contains(x)`,
`reveal_with_fuel` and the `isqrt`/`rev` facts as broadcast lemmas brought
in inside the task's proof fn, since a module-level `broadcast use` of a
recursive lemma is a cycle Verus refuses, measured 2026-10-06; its
nonlinear arithmetic is off unhinted, so `cube` and `root_floor` read
unproved there), SPARK (`Min`,
`Max`, `abs` of `Big_Integers` directly; `Greatest_Common_Divisor` under a
zero guard; `T_Pow`, `T_Isqrt`, `T_Sum`, `T_Rev`, `T_Contains` as
recursive expression functions with `Subprogram_Variant`), F*
(`FStar.Math.Lib`'s `abs`, `max`, `min`, `powx`; `t_gcd`, `t_isqrt`,
`t_sum`, `t_rev` as `let rec`; `Seq.mem`). Lean since 2026-10-06 (PREDICT
T9, the first landing of the depth programme in
`internal/RESEARCH-2026-10-06-landscape.md`): core Lean only, every
function by structural recursion so the kernel's own `decide` evaluates a
ground value (a well-founded definition, core's `List.mergeSort` among
them, does not reduce under `decide`, and `native_decide` is banned):
`t_min`, `t_max`, `t_abs`, `t_gcd` (`Int.gcd` cast back to an int),
`t_pow` and `t_isqrt` over `Nat`, `t_sum` with its append lemma, `t_rev`
as `List.reverse`, membership as `List` membership, and `sort` as a stable
insertion sort (the list Python's `sorted` gives) with its permutation,
order and length lemmas; `isqrt`'s bounds reach `grind` through a
`grind_pattern` (measured: handed the lemma alone, grind did not
instantiate it). Rocq since 2026-10-06 (PREDICT T10), over its own
sequence encoding, a function `Z -> Z` with a length (`t/rocq_lib.py`):
`Z.min`, `Z.max`, `Z.abs`, `Z.gcd`, `Z.pow`, `Z.sqrt` from the stdlib,
with gcd's sign and isqrt's bounds (`Z.sqrt_spec`) posed as facts before
the proof engine runs; `sum`, membership and the extrema as fuel
`Fixpoint`s over `Z.to_nat` of the length, recursing from the end;
membership in a seq stated as the existential over indices, its decided
bool bridged by `t_memb_spec`; `rev` as `fun k => f (n - 1 - k)`; `sort`
as a stable insertion sort over the listed elements, read back as a
function, with its order lemma. Frama-C since 2026-10-06 (PREDICT T11,
`t/framac_lib.py`): ACSL's own `\min`, `\max`, `\abs` in a specification
and a C conditional in code; `gcd`, `pow`, `isqrt`, `sum`, max/min of one
argument as ACSL `logic` definitions, each recursive one with its
termination lemma (proved by WP; the adapter reads a missing one as
vacuous), and in code as small C helper functions whose loops mirror the
logic recursion one step per iteration, each proved once against its own
contract; membership in a seq as the existential over indices, with
`t_memb_c` in code; `sum` of a display as its definitional unfolding. No
ACSL axiom is emitted. Not yet in Frama-C: `rev` and `sort` (a sequence
value built in code), any/all, `toset`, a sum over a concatenation. The
writer's side:
`to_python.py` hands back `min`, `max`, `abs`, `sum`, `math.gcd`, `a **
n`, `math.isqrt`, `x in s` and `s[::-1]`.

**The committed tasks:** `clamp` (`max(lo, min(hi, x))`), `distance`
(`abs(a - b)`), `sum_tail` (`r == sum(s + [x])` from `sum(s) + x`: one
unfolding of the definition, which Dafny's default fuel reaches where the
two of `sum([a, b])` were not, measured 2026-10-06; the adapter bans fuel
attributes), `gcd_of` (`r == gcd(a, b)`, a use of the library, not a
theorem about it: its first form asked `gcd(b, a) == gcd(a, b)`), `cube`
(`r == pow(x, 3)`), `root_floor` (`isqrt` under `requires n >= 0`),
`has_elem` (`x in s` on a seq), `palindrome` (`s == rev(s)`), `last`
(`s[-1]`, the sugar).

### Loops as sugar (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the second half of the third landing, with the four
pages on receipt 8f5b4d0085b5 read first: Verus's `for idx in 0..n
invariant ...` is a `while` whose index is stepped at the end of each
iteration and whose `idx <= n` the loop supplies itself; Why3's and
Dafny's libraries state `Sorted`, permutation (occurrence counts or
multisets) and `Filter`/`Map` with their lemmas. This section is the
loop sugar; `sort`, comprehensions and the slice step follow as their own
sections when measured.

**Three forms, one statement.** The notation reads

```
for i in [a, b) invariant I ... { body }       // an index over the half-open range, as a quantifier's is written
for x in s invariant I ... { body }            // the elements of a seq, in order; the index is in scope as i_x
for i, x in s invariant I ... { body }         // the index and the element
```

and the parser expands each to the `while` the AST already has, so the
AST, the checker, the interpreter, the twins and every lowering see a
`while` and nothing new: `for i in [a, b)` is

```
var i: int := a;
while i < b
  invariant a <= i and i <= b
  invariant I ...
  decreases b - i
{ body; i := i + 1; }
```

and `for i, x in s` (or `for x in s`, with `i` spelled `i_x`) is

```
var i: int := 0;
while i < len(s)
  invariant 0 <= i and i <= len(s)
  invariant I ...
  decreases len(s) - i
{ var x: T := s[i]; body; i := i + 1; }
```

with `T` the element type of `s`, read by the checker's own typing of `s`
under the names in scope at the loop. The loop supplies the two bound
invariants and the `decreases`, as Verus's `for` does; the user writes
only what the body needs. The printer writes the expansion (as it writes
`s[a..]` expanded), so a `for` is written sugar and printed `while`.

**What the parser refuses, by name:** an assignment to the loop variable
or the index in the body (the step is the loop's); a bound `b` or a
sequence `s` that mentions a variable the body assigns (Python evaluates
the iterable once, this expansion re-reads it each iteration, and the two
agree only when it is fixed: so it must be); a loop variable or index
already declared in scope. A `return` inside the body is the early exit
"Early exit (v1)" already states for a `while`.

**Measured.** No kernel work: a lowering that carries `while` carries
`for`. The committed tasks: `count_pos_for` (`for i, x in s invariant 0 <=
c and c <= i`), `zeros_for` (`for i in [0, n)` building a seq by
concatenation), `any_neg_for` (`for x in s`, an early `return`).

Since the early exits landed later the same day (SPEC "Early exits (v1)"), a
`continue` at the `for` body's own level (under its `if`s, not inside a nested
loop) expands to `i := i + 1; continue;`, so the step the sugar puts at the
end of the body is still taken; a `break` needs nothing.

### Sorting (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, after the loop sugar, with the library pages on receipt
8f5b4d0085b5 read first: Dafny's `Std.Collections.Seq.MergeSortBy` ensures
`multiset(a) == multiset(result)` and `SortedBy`; Why3's `seq.mlw` states
`sorted` as `forall i1 i2. l <= i1 <= i2 < u -> le s[i1] s[i2]` and a
permutation through occurrence counts (`occ_all`); Verus's `sort_by`
carries `lemma_sort_by_ensures` (multiset equality and `sorted_by`); Lean
defines `mergeSort` for verification and swaps in an efficient sort at run
time. The census: `sort` is a burden on 2,908 problems (`sorted()` or
`.sort()`), expressible before this section only as a loop with its own
specification.

**One operator.** `sort(s)`, written as a call and resolved by name like
the library's, takes a `seq` or a `seq<real>` and gives a seq of the same
type (any other element type is ill-typed: the order is the type's own
`<=`). Its meaning is the unique sorted permutation:

```
len(sort(s)) == len(s)
forall i, j. 0 <= i < j < len(s) ==> sort(s)[i] <= sort(s)[j]              (sorted, non-decreasing)
forall x. count(sort(s), x) == count(s, x)                                 (a permutation: the same occurrences)
```

where `count(s, x)` is the number of indices `i` with `s[i] == x` (the
string library's `count` of the one-element seq `[x]`, which on a seq of
ints is exactly that number). Stable sorting is not a notion here: equal
elements are equal. The interpreter sorts (Python's own, exact on ints and
on `Fraction`s).

**The twins.** No new move: `sort` is total and takes one argument, so
WRONG-VAR, WRONG-CONSTANT and the rest reach around it as around `rev`.

**Each lowering** emits a definition when the task uses `sort`: Dafny
`t_sort` as an insertion sort over `seq<int>` (or `seq<real>`) with the
ensures `multiset(r) == multiset(s)` and `t_sorted(r)` (a recursive
insertion whose postconditions Dafny proves by induction, the Std's
shapes), Verus `s.sort_by(|a: int, b: int| a <= b)` with vstd's own
`lemma_sort_by_ensures` called inside the proof fn; F*, SPARK, Lean, Rocq
and Frama-C abstain by name until their encodings are built and
measured. The writer's side: `to_python.py` hands back `sorted(s)`.

**The committed tasks:** `sort_it` (`r := sort(s)` with the sorted
clause as its `ensures`), `first_sorted` (`r == sort(s)[0]` under
`requires len(s) > 0`).

### Comprehensions (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the last part of the third landing, with the pages on
receipt 8f5b4d0085b5 read first: Dafny's `Std.Collections.Seq.Filter` and
`Map` are opaque recursive functions carrying their ensures (every element
of a filter satisfies the predicate and the length does not grow; a map
has the length of its source and the image at every index); Verus's
`filter` and `map_values` are the same shapes with `reveal_with_fuel` and
lemmas; Why3 builds a sequence by `create (len, fun i -> ...)`. The census:
`comprehension` is a burden on 5,920 problems, the single largest after
the string ones.

**One expression form.** A seq comprehension is an expression with a
bound variable, as a quantifier is:

```
{"comp": {"var": Id, "seq": Expr, "cond": Expr, "body": Expr}}           // [body for var in seq if cond]
{"comp": {"var": Id, "lo": Expr, "hi": Expr, "cond": Expr, "body": Expr}} // [body for var in [lo, hi) if cond]
```

written `[e for x in s if p]` and `[e for i in [a, b) if p]`; `if p` may
be omitted, and then `"cond"` is the literal `true`. The bound variable
has the element type of `s` (an int over a range) and scopes over `cond`
and `body` only; the result has type `seq<U>` for `U` the type of `body`
(`seq` when `U` is `int`). The value is the sequence of `body` at each
element (each index) in order for which `cond` holds. Definedness: `s`
(or `lo` and `hi`) must be defined; `cond` at every element; `body` at
every element where `cond` holds; so `[s[i] for i in [0, len(s))]` is
defined and `[s[i] for i in [0, len(s) + 1)]` is not, exactly as the
quantifier rules state. No set or map comprehension here: a set is built
by a loop until "Maps" lands.

**The twins.** No new move: OFF-BY-ONE reaches a literal bound,
COMPARE-FLIP and BOUNDARY-SWAP reach `cond`, WRONG-VAR a free variable in
`body` or `cond` (never the bound one, which carries no declared type in
scope, as a quantifier's does not). The interpreter evaluates the form
directly.

**Each lowering** emits one recursive function per comprehension SHAPE in the
file (`t_comp1`, `t_comp2`, ...: the bound variable, `cond`, `body` and the
source's type; since the early-exits landing the same day, so that the
same comprehension over a prefix `s[0..i]` and over `s` is one function
and the two meet by the slice axiom), over the sequence (or the two bounds)
and every free variable of `cond` and `body` other than the bound one,
recursing from the end as the Std's `Filter` does, and gives it the ensures
the shape admits: for `[x for x in s if p]` (a filter) every element of the
result satisfies `p` and the length does not grow; for `[e for x in s]`
(a map) the length is `len(s)` and the element at `i` is `e` at `s[i]`;
for `[e for i in [a, b)]` the length is `b - a` when `a <= b` and the
element at `k` is `e` at `a + k`; for a filter-and-map, the length bound
only. Dafny and Verus carry it (Verus with the ensures as a broadcast
lemma, as for `rev`). Lean since 2026-10-06 (PREDICT T12): each shape one
function in the same prefix form, by structural recursion over `Nat`
(appending the element's image when the filter holds), with the lemmas
its shape admits generated beside it and proved by induction: a map's
length and its element at an int index (and, for a range from 0, the
element with `0 + i` already simplified, which grind did not do under
`toNat`), a filter's length bound and that every element satisfies it; a
partial body owes its definedness at every index of the source. Rocq since
2026-10-06 (PREDICT T14): its sequences are a function from `Z` with a length,
so a map is its own pair and needs no recursive function: over a seq,
`(fun k => body[x := s k], len s)`; over a range, `(fun k => body[i := lo + k],
Z.max 0 (hi - lo))`, the index alone when `lo` is the literal 0; the body owes
its definedness at every element. A filter, and a comprehension inside a
spec_fun, method or lemma, refuse by name in Rocq until a filter's
construction is built and measured. F* since 2026-10-06 (PREDICT T16): each
map shape is one function `t_compK` in the prefix form above, built by
`Seq.init` with one call of `Seq.init_index`, so its postcondition carries the
length and every element; the definedness is its precondition, the conjuncts
that do not mention the element stated once (`t_n > 0 ==> ...`) and the rest
as a quantifier triggered on the element (`t_ix` over a range, as in Dafny); a
filter refuses by name. SPARK since 2026-10-07 (PREDICT T18): each map shape is
one recursive expression function `T_CompK` in T_Slice's shape (a Pre with the
definedness, a Post with the length and every element over T_Range, a
Subprogram_Variant on a nonnegative count clamped at the call site), its
recursion guarded by `R_Has (T_Range'(0, T_N), T_N - 1)`, the Has_Element term
through which a T_Range quantifier is instantiated, and its index over a range
written through the identity `T_Ix`. Frama-C since the same day (PREDICT T19):
a map that is the whole right-hand side of an assignment to a seq is one write
loop over the buffer, the slice copy loop with the body's value, each step
asserting the body's definedness, the count asserted as an ACSL term, and
`s[a..b][i]` in the body read as `s[a + i]` with the slice's definedness; a
map anywhere else refuses by name. So every kernel now carries a map; a filter
is carried by Dafny, Verus and Lean, and refused by name elsewhere. Dafny, since
the stepped-slice landing later the same day (T3c) and the
early-exits landing after it (T4), writes every comprehension function in
PREFIX form: over a sequence, `t_compK(t_s, t_n)` is the comprehension of
the first `t_n` elements of `t_s` (`requires 0 <= t_n <= |t_s|`), called
as `t_compK(s, |s|)` for a source `s` and as `t_compK(s, e)` for a source
`s[0..e]`, so the comprehension over a prefix in a loop invariant and the
one over the whole in the ensures are one function and one unfolding apart
(measured: `count_evens_skip`, whose invariant `c == len([y for y in
s[0..i] if y % 2 == 0])` was not maintained while the two were calls on
different sequences, `s[0..i+1][..i]` and `s[0..i]`, which Dafny does not
equate unprompted); over a range `[a, b)`, `t_compK(t_a, t_n)` is the
comprehension of `t_a, ..., t_a + t_n - 1` (`t_n = b - a`, empty when
negative), its index written `t_a + t_ix(t_di)` through the identity
function `t_ix`, which gives Dafny a term to match the precondition on (a
precondition over a bare index had none: `index out of range` inside the
function, 2026-10-06 19:40Z). The precondition is the definedness rule
above stated over the element as the Std's `Map` requires
`f.requires(xs[i])`: `requires forall t_di :: 0 <= t_di < t_n ==> D[x :=
t_s[t_di]]` (or `t_a + t_ix(t_di)`), `D` the definedness formula of `cond`
and of `body` under `cond` (the same formula every kernel's obligations
use); the conjuncts of `D` that do not mention the element are stated
once, as `t_n > 0 ==> ...`, because the ensures' own well-formedness needs
them before any element is at hand (measured on `odd_positions`), and
nothing is stated when `D` is `true`. Measured first: without any
precondition, `[s[i + 1] - s[i] for i in [0, len(s) - 1)]` failed Dafny's
own well-formedness check inside the function and read `unproved` for the
real and the twin alike (Verus verified it with the twin refuted). The writer's side: `to_python.py` hands back
the Python comprehension as a tuple.

**The committed tasks:** `evens` (`[x for x in s if x % 2 == 0]`, every
element even), `doubled` (`[2 * x for x in s]`, the length and each
element), `squares` (`[i * i for i in [0, n)]`, the length).

### Stepped slices (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the fourth landing's first form, with the pages on
receipt 1aed78ce1ef5 read first: Python's `s[i:j:k]` is "the sequence of
items with index `x = i + n*k` such that `0 <= n < (j-i)/k`", `k` never
zero, a negative `k` running backwards; Dafny's `s[i:j:k]` is a different
thing (a sequence of consecutive subsequences of lengths `i`, `j`, `k`),
its `s[lo..hi]` the two-bound slice t already has; Verus's
`Seq::subrange` likewise has no step. The census: `seq-slice-step` is a
gap on 852 problems, nearly all of them `s[::2]`, `s[1::2]` and the
reversal `s[::-1]`.

**Sugar, not a form.** `s[a..b..k]`, for `k` a positive literal, is the
elements of `s[a..b]` at offsets `0, k, 2k, ...`: the parser expands it to
the range comprehension

```
[s[a..b][k * i] for i in [0, (len(s[a..b]) + k - 1) / k)]
```

(`k * i` and `+ k - 1` folded away when `k` is 1), the AST carries only
the comprehension, and the printer writes the comprehension back. So its
meaning and definedness are the slice's and the comprehension's: defined
iff `0 <= a <= b <= len(s)` (the slice is evaluated in the bound), of
length `ceil((b - a) / k)`, with element `j` equal to `s[a + k * j]`; a
kernel proves exactly that through the range comprehension's ensures. The
bound variable is the first of `i`, `j`, `k`, `i2`, `j2`, `k2`, ... that
occurs nowhere in the program, so it shadows nothing. A step of `0` is
refused by name (no step); a negative step is Python's reversal, which is
`rev(s)` in t (`rev(s[a..b])` for a bounded one); a variable step is
written as the comprehension by hand, since the division it needs is the
author's to state. Both bounds are written: `s[a..b..k]` only.

**The twins and the kernels.** Nothing new: the twins reach the slice's
bounds and the step's literal through the comprehension, and every kernel
carries or abstains on the comprehension as before. The census counts a
positive literal step IN THE FRAGMENT, the bare reversal as `rev`, and any
other step (a variable, a negative one with a bound) as the gap
`seq-slice-step-other`.

**The committed tasks:** `every_other` (`s[0..len(s)..2]`: length
`(len(s) + 1) / 2`, element `k` is `s[2 * k]`) and `odd_positions`
(`s[1..len(s)..2]` on a non-empty `s`: length `len(s) / 2`, element `k` is
`s[2 * k + 1]`); with them `diffs` (`[s[i + 1] - s[i] for i in [0, len(s)
- 1)]`), the indexed-body comprehension whose Dafny proof this landing
repaired (the comprehension section's lowering paragraph).

### Early exits (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the fourth landing's second form, with the pages on
receipt d8d236f078af read first: Dafny's `break` and `continue`
(reference 8.14) transfer control out of, or to the head of, the innermost
loop, and a probe (2026-10-06 21:40Z) measured its rule: a loop invariant
false at a `break` is accepted and the exit path keeps what held there; at
a `continue` the invariant is checked; `while true` verifies with its
`decreases`. Verus writes the same loops as its own `while` with
invariants (the guide's "Loops and invariants"); Python's `while` and
`for` carry `break` and `continue`, and `while True` is the idiom for a
loop whose exit is in its body. The census: `unbounded-loop` is a gap on
4,403 problems (every `while True`, `break` and `continue`), the largest
single gap left.

**Two statements and one guard.**

```
{"break": true}      // break;     leaves the innermost enclosing loop
{"continue": true}   // continue;  ends this iteration; control returns to the loop's head
```

and `while true` is the loop whose guard is the literal `true`. Both
statements belong to a loop body (checker rule `exit-outside-loop`); no
statement follows either in its block (`exit-unreachable`, as for
`return`); a `while true` holds a `break` at its own level (under `if`s,
not inside a nested loop) or a `return` anywhere in its body
(`loop-exit`), since otherwise it never ends. The semantics is the
standard package with two more exits: at a `continue`, the invariants must
hold and `decreases` must have strictly decreased since the head, exactly
as at the end of the body; at a `break`, the invariants need NOT hold, and
control continues after the loop with the state as it stands there. After
the loop, a kernel therefore knows the invariants and the negated guard on
a normal exit, and on a `break` what held at it (path by path, as Dafny
reasons); for `while true` there is no normal exit, so everything known
after the loop comes from its breaks (and a `return` ends the task as
before). `decreases` stays required on every loop and must be `>= 0`
whenever the body runs, which for `while true` is every arrival at the
head. The frame rule is unchanged: `break` and `continue` assign nothing.
Definedness: nothing new.

**The `for` sugar.** A `continue` at a `for` body's own level becomes
`i := i + 1; continue;` in the expansion (the sugar's step sits at the end
of the body, which a `continue` would skip); a `break` needs nothing.

**The twins.** One new move, DROP-EXIT: a `break` or `continue` deleted,
the forgotten early exit. A twin whose `while true` thereby loses its only
exit is ill-formed (`loop-exit`) and never proposed; one that runs forever
at the witness is undefined there and is not a certificate.

**The lowerings.** Dafny carries all three as its own `break;`,
`continue;` and `while true` (the probe above and the committed tasks).
Verus, which writes a loop as a recursive proof function, and F*, SPARK,
Lean, Rocq and Frama-C abstain by name on a body with an early exit until
built and measured (`tshape.has_exit`). The hand-back writes Python's
`break` and `continue`.

**The committed tasks:** `index_of` (`while i < len(s)` with a `break` at
the first match: `r <= len(s)`, the element at `r` when `r < len(s)`, none
before it), `find_zero` (`while true` with two breaks, at the end and at
the first zero), `count_evens_skip` (`for i, x in s` with `continue` on
the odd elements, counting the rest: `c == len([y for y in s if y % 2 ==
0])`, the invariant the same count over `s[0..i]`).

### Maps (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, the fourth landing's third form, with the pages on
receipt 85a79b86b0ce read first: Dafny's `map<T, U>` (reference 5.5.4)
with the display `map[k := v, ...]`, selection `m[k]` (defined for `k in
m`), update `m[k := u]`, domain membership `k in m`, cardinality `|m|`,
`m.Keys`, and domain subtraction `m - s`; vstd's `Map<K, V>` for
specifications, with `dom()`, `index`, `insert`, `remove`, `len` and its
broadcast lemmas on insert and remove; Python's `dict`, the census'
semantics of record. The census: `map` is a gap on 2,464 problems, the
fourth-largest.

**One type, one display, six operations.**

```
{"map": [K, V]}                                        // map<K, V>; K any type with t equality, V any type
{"op": "mapdisp", "args": [k1, v1, ..., kn, vn]}       // map[k1 := v1, ..., kn := vn]; map[] the empty map
{"op": "at",      "args": [MapExpr, KExpr]}            // m[k]; DEFINED IFF k in m
{"op": "update",  "args": [MapExpr, KExpr, VExpr]}     // m[k := v]; the map with k mapped to v; always defined
{"op": "in",      "args": [KExpr, MapExpr]}            // k in m; domain membership
{"op": "len",     "args": [MapExpr]}                   // len(m); the number of keys
{"op": "keys",    "args": [MapExpr]}                   // keys(m); the domain, a set<K>
{"op": "remove",  "args": [MapExpr, KExpr]}            // remove(m, k); the map without k; always defined
```

`at`, `update`, `in` and `len` are the polymorphic operators seqs and
sets already have, chosen by the operand's type; `keys` and `remove` are
library names, resolved after parsing like `min` and `rev` (a declared
spec_fun, method or lemma of that name shadows them). A display's keys are
of one type and its values of one type; with two equal keys the rightmost
wins, as in Python and as a chain of updates says, which is how every
kernel writes a display; `map[]` takes the type its position expects and
is the `map<int, int>` empty map where none reaches it. `==` and `!=` on
two maps are extensional (the same keys, the same value at each), the
polymorphic `==` again. There is no order on a map and no iteration over
one: a quantifier still ranges over `[lo, hi)`, so "every key satisfies
P" is written over a sequence of candidates (`forall i in [0, len(s)) .
s[i] in m`), and a loop over a map's keys is not in v1 (the census names
it `map-iteration`). Definedness: `m[k]` owes `k in m`; everything else is
total.

**The interpreter and the twins.** A map's runtime value is its own
class, a sorted tuple of key/value pairs (hashable, so the witness ladder
dedups it, and tagged so it never compares equal to a seq of pairs); the
ladder for a `map<K, V>` name is every map over the first three keys of
`K`'s ladder and the first two values of `V`'s, the empty map first. The
twin ladder needs no new move: WRONG-VAR swaps two map-typed names,
OFF-BY-ONE and WRONG-CONSTANT reach the ints inside a display or a key,
DROP-GUARD a membership test.

**Each lowering** uses its kernel's own map: Dafny's `map<K, V>` with
`map[]` built up by `[k := v]` updates (so the rightmost key wins
whatever Dafny's display rule), `m[k]`, `m[k := v]`, `k in m`, `|m|`,
`m.Keys` and `m - {k}`; Verus's `Map<K, V>` with `Map::empty().insert(k,
v)`, `m[k]`, `m.insert(k, v)`, `m.dom().contains(k)`, `m.len() as int`,
`m.dom()` and `m.remove(k)`, the `==` of two maps bridged by `=~=` as a
set's is. F*, SPARK, Lean, Rocq and Frama-C abstain by name on the type
until built and measured. The hand-back writes Python's dict.

**The committed tasks:** `lookup_or` (`if k in m then m[k] else d`),
`put_key` (`m[k := v]`: the key is in, its value is `v`, the size does
not shrink, `remove(r, k) == remove(m, k)`), `index_map` (a loop
`m := m[x := i]` over `s`: every element of `s` is a key and `len(m) <=
len(s)`).

### Reductions (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06, after a measurement of the corpus's generator
expressions (receipt 4c05105b66f2, with the pages read first: Python's
built-in `any`, `all`, `max`, `min` and `set`; Dafny's Std `Seq.Max`/`Min`,
recursive with `requires 0 < |xs|` and the ensures that the result is in
the sequence and bounds every element, and `ToSet(xs) = set x | x in xs`;
vstd's `Seq<int>::max`/`min` with `max_ensures`/`min_ensures` and
`Seq::to_set` with its broadcast ensures). Of 1,047 corpus solutions with
a generator expression, 405 feed `sum`, 293 `join`, 114 `all`, 65 `max`,
65 `any`, 55 `sorted`, 53 `tuple`, 50 `min`: a comprehension under a
reduction. The library gains the reductions the comprehension lacked:

```
{"op": "any",   "args": [SeqBoolExpr]}   // any(s): some element is true; any([]) is false
{"op": "all",   "args": [SeqBoolExpr]}   // all(s): every element is true; all([]) is true
{"op": "max",   "args": [SeqExpr]}       // max(s): the largest element; DEFINED IFF len(s) > 0
{"op": "min",   "args": [SeqExpr]}       // min(s): the smallest element; DEFINED IFF len(s) > 0
{"op": "toset", "args": [SeqExpr]}       // toset(s): the set of the elements, duplicates collapsed
```

`max` and `min` are the two-argument library functions at a second arity,
over a `seq` of ints or a `seq<real>`, with the element type as result;
`any`/`all` take a `seq<bool>`; `toset` takes a `seq<T>` and gives a
`set<T>`. All are library names, resolved after parsing like `sum` (a
declared name shadows them). Definedness: `max`/`min` of one argument owe
`len(s) > 0`; the other three are total. The interpreter is Python's own
`any`, `all`, `max`, `min` and `frozenset`.

**The lowerings.** Dafny: `t_any`/`t_all` as the bounded quantifiers over
the sequence, `t_maxs`/`t_mins` (and the real twins) in the Std's shape,
recursive with `requires |s| > 0` and the two ensures, `t_toset` as the set
comprehension `set x | x in s`. Verus: `t_any`/`t_all` as spec fns with
a quantifier, `max(s)`/`min(s)` as vstd's own `s.max()`/`s.min()` with
`max_ensures()`/`min_ensures()` stated inside the proof fn for every use
over the parameters (vstd's lemmas are not broadcast), `toset(s)` as
`s.to_set()`. Lean (since 2026-10-06, PREDICT T9): `max(s)`/`min(s)` as
structurally recursive `t_maxs`/`t_mins` with membership and bound lemmas,
`any`/`all` as core's `List.any`/`List.all` over a predicate (a
comprehension of a seq under them is the predicate), carried to the index
quantifier by two bridge lemmas; `toset` stays refused (core Lean has no
finite set). Rocq (since 2026-10-06, PREDICT T10): `t_maxs`/`t_mins` and
`t_all`/`t_any` as fuel `Fixpoint`s with their facts, an `any`'s bool
predicate carried to the spec's Prop under the binder by a pointwise bridge
(`setoid_rewrite`); `toset` refused. F*, SPARK and Frama-C abstain by name.
The hand-back writes Python's own built-ins.

**The twins.** No new move: WRONG-CONSTANT and OFF-BY-ONE reach the ints
inside the comprehension a reduction consumes, COMPARE-FLIP its condition.

**The committed tasks:** `all_positive` (`all([x > 0 for x in s])` against
the quantifier), `has_negative` (`any([x < 0 for x in s])` against the
existential), `largest` (`max(s)` on a non-empty sequence: in it, above
every element), `members_upto` (`toset(s[0..n])`: every element of the
prefix is in it).

### Higher-order calls (v1)

Stated 2026-10-06 (PREDICT T8, registered before any run; receipt
b27338128981 for the semantics read first: Python's `functools.reduce`,
left to right with the initial value first; `sorted`, stable; `max` and
`min` with a key, the first maximal or minimal item; receipt f70120c23d30
for the Verus side: vstd's `seq_lib.rs` and the guide's pages on
broadcast lemmas and on recursion and fuel). Measured first on the
corpus's first solutions: of the uses behind the census gap `closure`
(2,243 problems), the higher-order ones are sort keys 185 (`sorted` 107,
`.sort` 78), `map` 68, `filter` 26, `max`/`min` keys 35 and `reduce` 24;
beside them 419 lambdas bound to a name and 347 nested defs, 336 of them
without `nonlocal`.

A lambda is an expression with one or two bound parameters, allowed in
exactly one place: the function argument of four library calls.

```
{"lam": {"vars": [Id], "body": Expr}}         // written x => e
{"lam": {"vars": [Id, Id], "body": Expr}}     // written (a, x) => e
{"op": "fold",    "args": [Lam2, Init, SeqExpr]}  // fold(f, init, s): f(...f(f(init, s[0]), s[1])..., s[n-1])
{"op": "sort_by", "args": [SeqExpr, Lam1]}    // sort_by(s, key): s ordered by key, stable
{"op": "max_by",  "args": [SeqExpr, Lam1]}    // max_by(s, key): the first element whose key is largest
{"op": "min_by",  "args": [SeqExpr, Lam1]}    // min_by(s, key): the first element whose key is smallest
```

Typing (the checker's `hof-types` rule): `fold`'s lambda takes the
accumulator first (the type of `init`, `A`) and the element second (the
sequence's element type, `T`), and its body has type `A`; the result is
`A`. A key takes `T` and gives an `int` or a `real`; `sort_by` gives
`seq<T>`, `max_by` and `min_by` give `T`. A lambda's parameters scope over
its body only and may not shadow a name in scope (the quantifier rule,
`quant-shadow`). A lambda anywhere else is refused (`lambda-position`):
there are no function values, no function types, and no function returned
or stored. The four names are library names, resolved after parsing; a
declared name shadows them.

Definedness: `max_by` and `min_by` owe `len(s) > 0`; the sequence and
`init` are defined; the lambda's body is defined at every element it is
applied to. A lowering refuses by name a lambda whose body is partial
(an index, a division) rather than state the obligation per element. The
interpreter is Python's own `functools.reduce`, `sorted(key=)`, `max(key=)`
and `min(key=)`; the hand-back writes them.

**The lowerings.** Each call shape (the op and its lambda, the lambda's
parameters renamed so that an invariant's `(a, y) => a + w * y` and an
ensures' `(a, x) => a + w * x` are one shape: measured, as two functions
they never met) becomes one recursive function in PREFIX form, over the
first `t_n` elements of `t_s`, with the lambda's free names as further
parameters: a call on `s[0..e]` is `(s, e)`, any other is `(s, len(s))`,
so a loop invariant over a prefix and a postcondition over the whole are
one unfolding apart and meet by congruence. Dafny: `fold` and the extrema
are functions whose ensures (the extreme is in the sequence and bounds
every key) are proved by induction from the definition; `sort_by` is a
stable insertion sort (a later element is inserted after the equal keys
before it) whose ensures (length, multiset, membership, key order) need
two explicit lemmas, an upper bound on the keys an insertion yields and
order preservation, called from inside the sort function: a quantified
bound in a postcondition gave Dafny no instantiation (the registered
falsifier; the lemma was written, as registered). Verus: the same
functions as `spec fn`s; `max_by`/`min_by` through the index of the
chosen element, with a broadcast lemma for its bounds and the key order;
`sort_by` as the same insertion sort, since vstd's `lemma_sort_by_ensures`
requires a total order (antisymmetric, `relations.rs`) and a key
comparison is only a preorder; its facts come from three insertion lemmas
and vstd's `to_multiset_ensures`, with each count term named (the
`contains <==> count > 0` fact triggers on a count term only: measured,
the membership asserts failed without them). Measured on a hand probe
before the generator was written: 14 verified, 0 errors. Lean (since
2026-10-06, PREDICT T9): `fold`, `max_by` and `min_by` in the same prefix
form, by structural recursion over `Nat` (so ground values evaluate under
`decide`), with fold's zero and step equations stated at an int index (the
form a loop's invariant reaches) and the extrema's chosen-index bounds,
membership and key bound; `sort_by` is refused by name there. SPARK,
Frama-C, Rocq and F* abstain by name.

**The certificates.** A ground `fold` becomes the nested body it denotes
and a ground `max_by`/`min_by` the nested choice, so the kernel computes
the value (in Verus, at most eight elements: the choice doubles per
element); a ground `sort_by` is not unrolled and its certificate is
refused.

**The twins.** The ladder's moves reach a lambda's body (WRONG-CONSTANT,
OFF-BY-ONE, COMPARE-FLIP inside it); WRONG-OPERATOR swaps `max_by` and
`min_by`.

**The census.** A lambda as a sort, max or min key, as the function of
`map`, `filter` or `reduce`, or bound to a name, and a nested def that
neither rebinds (`nonlocal`) nor mutates a name it captured (an append, a
subscript or attribute store: t's values are immutable), are in the
fragment (the burden `higher-order`): t states a nested def as a top-level
helper with its captures as parameters. `functools`'s `reduce` is a
modelled import. In the fragment: 2,773 -> 2,959 of 4,239 function-shaped
problems; the gap `closure` 2,243 -> 707 (other lambda positions, and
nested defs that mutate what they capture).

**The committed tasks:** `longest_row` (`max_by` over rows by length),
`cheapest` (`min_by` over pairs by the second component), `by_second`
(`sort_by` over pairs: length, adjacent key order, every input element in
the output), `weighted_sum` (a loop whose invariant is the fold over the
prefix and whose postcondition is the fold over the whole).

## The twins

A ladder of mutation operators. None is optional or configurable; the choice
is derived from the body by one deterministic rule, applied identically to
every task, so "the twin failed" always means the same thing. The twin never
touches `requires`, `ensures`, `spec_funs`, or the task/loop `decreases`
clauses that survive in the mutated body. The spec is the fixed instrument;
the body and its annotations are what gets broken.

**Every twin must carry a witness.** This is the whole point and it is a
measurement, not an assumption. Measured over the 1395 generated tasks (7 seeds x
200 from `fuzz_lower.py`, less the 5 its own well-formedness check rejects)
that the fuzzer measures, 129 of them, 9.2%, and 13 to 22 per seed, had a
twin that computes an IDENTICAL value to the real program on every input
tested. On those tasks the "measured flip" measures nothing: there is no
behavioural difference for a kernel to detect, so a REFUTED verdict is luck
and a VERIFIED twin cannot be told apart from a vacuous spec. So a mutation is
accepted only when `t/interp.py` produces one of:

- a value witness, an input satisfying `requires` on which the real body and
  the twin return different values, or on which the twin is undefined where
  the real body has a value (the value-changing operators); or
- a proof witness, a loop state satisfying `requires` and the SURVIVING
  invariants that either falsifies `ensures` with the guard false (exit
  entailment) or breaks a surviving invariant in one iteration (preservation).
  INVARIANT-DROP's twin computes the same value by construction, so this is
  the only thing there is to measure about it.

**2026-09-12 ("twin-order", ROADMAP 16.2): EXTENSIONAL rungs are tried
before INVARIANT-DROP, not after.** The order below reverses what shipped
2026-09-04 through 2026-09-11 (INVARIANT-DROP first): a body with a
behavioral rung -- one whose witness is a VALUE that falsifies `ensures`
-- gets that twin, and INVARIANT-DROP is the twin only for a body with no
behavioral rung at all. Reason: an INVARIANT-DROP twin is not a wrong
program. Every reachable loop-head state satisfies all of the real's
invariants, so dropping one leaves the rest true at every reachable state;
no reachable witness can refute the twin, and a kernel that proves it by
re-deriving the dropped invariant is not unsound -- this section's own
next paragraph already said as much ("Twin REFUTED means that invariant
is load-bearing: the kernel cannot re-derive it"), which implies a kernel
that VERIFIES it could not be shown wrong, only that it re-derived the
invariant on its own. Measured on the seven rows this reordering was
named for (ROADMAP 16.2, wave H): `isNonPrime`, `isPrime`,
`sumOfCommonDivisors`, `anyValueExists`, `containsSequence`, `containsK`,
`isSmaller` each carried an INVARIANT-DROP twin that dafny (interval
inference on the arithmetic three) or lean (`containsSequence`,
`containsK`) verified alongside the real, previously read `unsound`; all
seven now get a behavioral twin (COLLAPSE-IF or NEGATE-COND) that every
present kernel refutes. A companion fix in `interp.invariant_witness`
travels with this reorder: its preservation check ran one loop iteration
and required a surviving invariant to hold at whatever state that
iteration reached, including a state reached by a `return` INSIDE the
loop body -- a state the loop never revisits, where `ensures` is the
obligation, not a survivor (see "Early exit" above). `anyValueExists`,
`containsK`, `containsSequence` and `isSmaller` all return from inside
their loop, and this is what minted their spurious "preservation"
witness; the check now asks whether `ensures` holds at a returning
iteration, the same standard an ordinary loop exit already gets.
`harness.decorative_kind` gained a third label for the VERIFIED/VERIFIED
pairing this reorder still leaves possible for a body with NO behavioral
rung: "re-derived" (an INVARIANT-DROP proof witness, kind `exit` or
`preservation`) is a fact about that kernel's inference, never folded
into "unsound" (kept for a VALUE witness, `_ens is True`, a kernel
verified anyway).

The operators, tried in this fixed order, with sites inside an operator
enumerated in pre-order (statement, then into `if` branches and `while`
bodies), first candidate with a witness winning:

1. **COLLAPSE-IF** (v0): one `if` is replaced by its then-branch.
2. **NEGATE-COND**: one `if`'s branches are swapped, which is `not cond`
   with no new syntax for a lowering to reject.
3. **COMPARE-FLIP**: `<` <-> `<=`, `>` <-> `>=` at one comparison.
4. **BOUNDARY-SWAP**: the operands of one order comparison are exchanged.
5. **OFF-BY-ONE**: +/-1 on one integer literal, `at` index, or loop bound.
6. **WRONG-VAR**: one variable occurrence is replaced by another of the same
   type in scope (never the return: reading it before its first assignment is
   ill-formed rather than wrong, and a lowering rejects it instead of
   refuting it).
7. **DROP-GUARD**: one conjunct of an `if`/`while` condition is dropped.
8. **WRONG-CONSTANT** (twin-ladder wave, 2026-09-11): one assign/return
   right-hand side or `var` initialiser, proved int-typed by
   `harness._int_rooted` (a literal, a variable of declared type `int`, or
   the result of `neg`/`len`/`*`/`-`/`div`/`mod`, never `+`, which this
   language also overloads for seq concatenation), is wrapped in `expr +- 1`.
   The rung a straight-line body with no `if`, no loop, no literal, and no
   `at`/`update`/`fill`/`slice` admits: OFF-BY-ONE has nothing to move there,
   since there is no literal or indexing op anywhere in the expression, only
   a computed value returned or assigned whole (`volume := size * size *
   size`, `ascii := c`).
9. **WRONG-OPERATOR** (twin-ladder wave, 2026-09-11): one arithmetic
    operator, `+`, `-`, `*`, `div`, or `mod`, is replaced by another from a
    fixed per-operator list (`+`/`-`/`*` cycle among themselves, `div` and
    `mod` swap), at every site COMPARE-FLIP's own walk reaches. Empty
    wherever the body has no arithmetic operator node, which none of rungs
    1-7 touch (COMPARE-FLIP and BOUNDARY-SWAP only ever rewrite an order
    comparison, never the arithmetic feeding one).
10. **INVARIANT-DROP** (v1): one invariant of one loop is deleted. An
    annotation mutation, tried only once every rung above has produced no
    witness (2026-09-12, "twin-order"; INVARIANT-DROP shipped first, v1,
    and was tried first through 2026-09-11). Twin REFUTED means that
    invariant is load-bearing: the kernel cannot re-derive it, so the
    stated proof outline is real work. Twin VERIFIED means the kernel
    re-derived it (or, before this rung is even reached, that the body had
    no behavioral rung of its own to prefer).

Rungs 8, 9 and 10 sit below every rung above in the tried-in-order search: a
task whose twin was already found by an earlier rung keeps that exact twin,
byte-identical, which is why rungs 8 and 9 close the five dafny_synthesis
rows that previously had no twin at all (`234 cubeVolume`,
`242 countCharacters`, `269 asciiValue`,
`626 areaOfLargestTriangleInSemicircle`, `792 countLists`: each a
straight-line arithmetic body with a single param and no `if`/loop, so
rungs 1-7 have nothing to mutate and `twin_for` returned `no-operator`)
and give `397 medianOfThree` a grounded, `ensures`-falsifying twin where
rungs 1-7 found only a "+nonrefuting" fallback: its `ensures` is a
disjunction that only pins the result to be ONE OF `a`, `b`, `c` (every
value-preserving permutation of which var gets returned trivially satisfies
both disjuncts by reflexivity, so no rung that merely swaps *which* of
`a`/`b`/`c` comes out can ever falsify it), while WRONG-CONSTANT's `+- 1`
produces a value equal to none of the three and falsifies the first
disjunct outright.

INVARIANT-DROP and COLLAPSE-IF at site 0, tried in THAT order (v1's own
order, invariant-drop first; twin-order's 2026-09-12 reorder above is a
later, separate change), are exactly the v1 rule, so a task whose v1 twin
was already load-bearing keeps that twin unchanged; measured over the same
1395 tasks, 96 twins changed and every one of them was a twin the
interpreter shows was vacuous: no twin that was already distinct moved
(unwitnessed: no committed table, log, or commit message restates this
96-count independent of this prose).

No witness on any rung and the task is REFUSED, with the reason named:
`no-witness` (every mutation computes what the real body computes),
`no-input` (nothing in the bounded domain satisfies `requires`, a vacuous
precondition), `real-undefined` (the real body returns no value), or
`no-operator` (nothing to mutate). An unmeasurable twin is reported as such,
never passed off as a flip.

A task counts ONLY when the real lowering is VERIFIED and the twin is REFUTED
by the actual kernel, both measured and never predicted. Twin VERIFIED now says
one specific thing, because the twin is known to be broken: the spec is
vacuous, or the dropped invariant's obligation is one the kernel re-derives.

**2026-09-11 (ROADMAP 13.3): a twin that VERIFIES is REFUSED, named.** A
column where the real lowering is VERIFIED and the twin is ALSO VERIFIED is
never counted as agreement and is never folded into a plain "no flip"
either: it is a named refusal, `decorative`, `unsound` or `re-derived`
(2026-09-12, below), and the three are counted separately because they are
different findings about different things. `harness.decorative_kind(real_outcome, twin_outcome, w)` is the one
place this is decided, from the SAME witness `twin_for` already measured
when it accepted the twin onto the ladder in the first place, never a fresh
guess:

- `decorative`: the ladder accepted this twin on its fallback path (a
  witness that shows real and twin compute DIFFERENT values but does not
  FALSIFY `ensures`, the "+nonrefuting" tag, `w["_ens"]` not `True` on a
  "value" witness). Nothing the harness measured entailed a refutation
  here, so the twin verifying too says the SPEC cannot tell real and twin
  apart in that column, canonically an `ensures true` or an `ensures` the
  mutation happens not to touch. This is a finding about the task's spec,
  not about the kernel, and it is a REFUSAL: the cell reads
  `verified / decorative`, e.g. in `t/AGREEMENT.md` and grade.py's
  `table.md`, and `t/fuzz_lower.py`'s summary counts it on its own
  `decorative` line, never inside `no_flip`.
- `unsound`: the witness DOES entail a refutation with a VALUE witness that
  falsifies `ensures` (`w["_ens"] is True`). A kernel that verifies such a
  twin anyway contradicts its OWN measured witness: a finding about that
  kernel, kept apart from `decorative` so the two are never averaged
  together and a kernel's own unsoundness cannot hide behind a weak spec's
  cover. The cell reads `verified / unsound`, and `fuzz_lower.py`'s summary
  counts it on its own `unsound` line.
- `re-derived` (2026-09-12, "twin-order", ROADMAP 16.2): the witness is an
  INVARIANT-DROP proof witness (kind `exit` or `preservation`). This is NOT
  the same finding as `unsound`, even though `interp.invariant_witness`'s
  own docstring says such a witness "means a kernel MUST refute the twin":
  every reachable loop-head state still satisfies every SURVIVING
  invariant (dropping one leaves the rest true), so no reachable witness
  can refute this twin, and a kernel that verifies it did so by
  RE-DERIVING the dropped annotation on its own -- interval inference, a
  stronger loop-invariant search, whatever that kernel's `while` rule
  already does. Before this reorder, INVARIANT-DROP was tried first, so
  this pairing was common enough to matter (`isNonPrime`, `isPrime`,
  `sumOfCommonDivisors` in dafny; `containsSequence`, `containsK` in lean,
  ROADMAP 16.2 wave H) and was folded into `unsound`, mislabeling a
  kernel's inference strength as a soundness defect. Now that EXTENSIONAL
  rungs win whenever one exists, `re-derived` only remains reachable for a
  body with NO behavioral rung at all. The cell reads
  `verified / re-derived`.

What this changes for the tables: before this paragraph, a real-VERIFIED,
twin-VERIFIED cell in `t/AGREEMENT.md`/`table.md` read as a bare
`verified / verified`, indistinguishable at a glance from a genuine
disagreement, and `fuzz_lower.py`'s `no_flip` statistic lumped it in with a
twin that came back UNPROVED or TIMEOUT, so `no_flip` measured the
fuzzer's spec strength (how many twins the ladder could not word strongly
enough) at the same time as it measured the kernels' twin discipline (how
many twins a sound kernel actually refuted). `no_flip` now counts ONLY
real-VERIFIED cells whose twin came back UNPROVED, TIMEOUT or MALFORMED,
which is the kernel's own twin discipline and nothing else; `decorative`
and `unsound` are their own counts, measured by
`t/test_twin_rule.py` and by `python3 t/fuzz_lower.py`'s printed summary.
The grounded ladder's own guarantee is unchanged by any of this: every twin
`twin_for` accepts carries a witness (SPEC.md "The twins" above), so
`decorative` and `unsound` are both about a WITNESSED twin a kernel still
verified, never about an unmeasurable one (those are `no-witness`,
`no-input`, `real-undefined` or `no-operator`, REFUSED before a kernel ever
sees them).

**2026-09-11 (ROADMAP 15.5): a REAL can be REFUTED too, and its witness is
measured the same way a twin's is.** `harness.real_witness(task)` runs the
same bounded interpreter search (`interp.Reference`, `interp.domain`) over
the REAL body alone, asking whether ITS OWN value ever violates `ensures`
at a `requires`-admitted input, or whether the body is undefined there;
`None` when the scan finds nothing, which is every one of the committed
tasks. When it is not `None`, `t/tlib.py` and `t/run_par.py` lower the
real with that witness (`lower(task, task["body"], witness=real_witness(task))`),
the exact form every lowering already accepts for a twin, so a genuinely
wrong real gets the same refutation certificate a wrong twin gets and
reads REFUTED with the kernel's own message, not merely UNPROVED. This is
what makes "a real task REFUTED with the kernel's message" (this section's
own bar) a measured outcome rather than an unreachable one.

**2026-09-11 (ROADMAP 13.4): the conformance suite's own probes read this
section, not a single verdict word, for two families.** `t/conformance.py`
grades `fuzz_lower.py`'s hand-built probes against `_expect`, and two
expectations there are EXPECTATION CLASSES rather than one outcome string,
because the probe's own point is: a non-well-founded `decreases`
(`fz_p_badrec`, `fz_p_badrec2`, `fz_p_badvariant`, this document's gate 3,
"well-definedness IS the termination obligation") or a `seq` length bounded
by a machine type (`fz_p_biglen`, `fz_p_seqlen`, gate 1's `len(s) >= 0`
with no upper bound) or a `requires` undefined at every type-correct input
(`fz_p_divreq0`, "Undefined `requires` (normative)" above) has NO PROOF for
a sound kernel to find, and a sound kernel can fail to find one in more
than one honest voice: REFUTED, UNPROVED, MALFORMED or LOWER-ERROR all
count as "rejected"; VERIFIED (the false theorem itself), TIMEOUT
("undecided" is not "saw the contradiction") and VACUOUS (accepted, for the
wrong reason) never do. `conformance.py`'s `REJECTED_OK` is this set, read
directly off `verifiers/__init__.py`'s `Outcome` vocabulary. And
`fz_p_vac_post` (`ensures true`) expects `decorative`, not `vacuous`: "The
twins" section above already names what a real-VERIFIED, twin-VERIFIED
pairing under the grounded ladder means, and `vacuous` (`Outcome.VACUOUS`)
is a different thing, one kernel's own verdict on one program, never a
statement about a real/twin pairing. `conformance.py`'s `grade()` calls
`harness.decorative_kind` on the measured pair for this probe, the same
function this section's own paragraph names, read rather than reinvented.

## What v1 does not claim

No unbounded quantifiers. No heap, no aliasing: `seq` is a value, and an
array with mutation is a `seq` updated functionally ("Sequences as
values"). No overflow semantics (mathematical integers; bounded backends
owe explicit range obligations). One return value. No mutual recursion,
no function values: since 2026-10-06 a lambda exists only as the function
argument of `fold`, `sort_by`, `max_by` and `min_by` ("Higher-order calls
(v1)"). A string is a seq of code points (stated
2026-09-09, sequence literals/concatenation/slices the same night); its
library (`split`, `join`, `tostr`, `count`, `find`, `strip`/`lstrip`/
`rstrip`, `replace`, `lower`/`upper`, `isdigit`/`isalpha`/`isupper`/
`islower`, `startswith`/`endswith`) landed 2026-09-11 -- not in it, each
by name: `format` and f-strings, `int(x, base)`, a multi-code-point
separator, `splitlines`, the padding members, `title`/`capitalize`/
`swapcase`, `partition`, `encode`. A pair is one value ("Pairs",
stated 2026-09-10): no pair of pairs, no seq of pairs, no triple. A nested seq is one
level deep ("Nested sequences", stated 2026-09-10): no third level, no seq
of bools, no seq of pairs.
Since 2026-10-06 ("Compositional types (v1)") a pair holds any two types,
a tuple three or more, a seq any element type at any depth and a set any
element type; what stays out by design is listed under "What does not
exist (on purpose)" in SYNTAX.md. These are gates to open with
measurements, not omissions to apologize for.

## Typed inline helpers (surface, v1)

Added 2026-09-19. A declaration `inline fun f(p: T, ...): R = e`
introduces a typed expression template in a t:1 source. It appears after the
task clauses and before the task body; spec-function and inline declarations
may be interleaved. Parameters and result use any existing t type. Parameter
names must be unique. Helper names must be unique across the inline helpers,
spec functions and task name. `inline` is a contextual word, not a new reserved
identifier. t:0 admits no inline declarations.

Each definition is checked in its parameter environment, with signatures of
only earlier inline helpers. Every definition must be well-typed, whether or
not it is called. Free task variables, recursion, forward helper references,
and calls from a helper to a spec function or task are rejected. Task
expressions and spec-function bodies and measures can call the declared
helpers. Every call has exactly the declared argument count and types; an
unused argument is still checked for scope and type errors.

The meaning of `f(actuals)` is **capture-avoiding substitution** of the actual
expressions for the formal parameters in `e`, after expanding earlier helpers.
Quantifier binders are renamed to fresh identifiers before substitution.
This is expression-template semantics, not evaluation of arguments before a
function call: an actual expression used twice occurs twice, an unused actual
has no runtime definedness obligation, and an actual under a short-circuit
branch is evaluated only when that branch is selected. For example, with
`inline fun keep(a: int): int = 7`, `keep(1 / 0)` means `7`, while
`keep(true)` is ill-typed. With `inline fun id(a: int): int = a`, `id(1 / 0)`
remains undefined. This distinction is the reason the declaration says `inline`.

Helpers carry no assumed contracts, termination axioms, or separate proof
claims. They add no preconditions, including at partial operators such as
indexing and division: all existing definedness obligations apply to the
expanded expression. An unused ill-defined helper body may be well-typed but
has no separate totality claim; each use must meet its expanded obligations.
After substitution the complete expanded task is checked by the ordinary
well-formedness checker without helper signatures. The seven existing
lowerings and the interpreter receive only that checked core AST. An
unsupported expanded shape must still abstain by name.

An empty expression declared or passed as `seq<seq>` is elaborated as the
existing core expression `seq(0, [])` where necessary to retain its nested
sequence type outside a contextual type position. This has the same empty
value and adds no definedness condition. The implementation bounds expansion
at 100,000 visited AST dictionary nodes across definition compilation and
substitution; exceeding this bound is a named elaboration refusal, never a
truncated program. Helpers are not a code-size or runtime performance promise.

Canonical printing discards inline declarations and prints the expanded core,
like the existing literal sugar. The required round trip compares expanded
ASTs: `parse(print(parse(source))) == parse(source)`. A context-free constrained
decoding grammar covers declaration structure; scope, type, acyclicity and
expansion-size rules are checked during elaboration. See
