# Shipped at machine width

Each routine's C lowering proved with WP's machine-integer model and `-wp-rte`, so every signed operation owes a no-overflow proof (t/ship.py). Where an overflow guard is open for the full range, the largest bound ±2^k on every int input and sequence element (lengths at most 1000) under which every goal proves is the routine's proved operating envelope.

- ships for every int32 input: 16
- ships within an envelope: 5
- no envelope found: 2
- contract open at machine width: 1
- not shipped (the C lowering refuses it): 1
