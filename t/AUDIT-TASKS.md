# Specification audit

Every one-edit mutant of each body, classed by the interpreter over the task's bounded domain (t/audit.py): **killed** (the spec rejects its result somewhere), **same** (computes the same everywhere), **diverges** (runs out of steps where the real body ends), **survivor** (computes something different, and the spec accepts it everywhere).

- tasks: 114; audited: 114; not audited: none
- behaviour-changing mutants the specs kill: 1541 of 1570 (98.2%)
- tasks whose spec admits a survivor: 6 of 114
- dafny: real body verified in 111 of 114; of those, a survivor proved too (a wrong program with a proof) in 5
